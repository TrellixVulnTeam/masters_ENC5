Peter Aldous, the MP for Waveney, announced he was the latest Tory writing to party officials demanding a confidence vote in Mr Johnson after civil servant Sue Gray’s report into the scandal condemned a “failure of leadership” at Number 10.

But the Prime Minister’s allies remain convinced the rebels are far short of the 54 letters needed to trigger a contest.

In a statement, Mr Aldous said: “After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the Prime Minister should resign.

“It is clear that he has no intention of doing so and I have therefore written to the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Backbench Conservative MPs, advising him that I have no confidence in the Prime Minister as Leader of the Conservative Party.

“I have never taken such action before and had hoped that I would not be put in such an invidious position.

“Whilst I am conscious that others will disagree with me, I believe that this is in the best interests of the country, the Government and the Conservative Party.”

Around 10 Tories have publicly confirmed they have written to the party’s 1922 Committee to call for a confidence vote, although some are understood to have withdrawn their letters in recent days.
