Asymptomatic viral infections in the first days and weeks of a baby's life are associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections later in life, research suggests., may avert this risk, experts say.Researchers from the University of Edinburgh and University Medical Center UtrechtThe team analyzed the gene activity of the babies' nasal mucosa , the microbes present in the lining of the nose and any viruses that infected the children.The investigators found in particular changes in immune system genes in response to early viruses in affected babies, with— proteins released by immune cells to defend against viruses — over the first year of life.The interferon-related gene activity caused by anexperts say.The research has been published in Nature Microbiology. The cohort study was carried out in close collaboration with the Spaarne Hospital, The Netherlands. The work was funded by Scotland's Chief Scientist Office and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research.to weeks of life might be essential for a healthy immune and microbiome development, and consequently long term respiratory health," says Professor Debby Bogaert, chair of pediatric medicine at the University of Edinburgh"Although, the data from this study indicate that early-life encounters with respiratory viruses — especially during the first days of life — may set the tone for subsequent non-beneficial host-microbe interactions, which are related to an infection risk and possibly long term respiratory health," says Dr. Wouter de Steenhuijsen, post-doctoral investigator at University Medical Center Utrecht
