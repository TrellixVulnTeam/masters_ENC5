Until now most of the robust rhetoric about Ukraine has come from the West.

Today, the Russian President joined the fray and the mood music by giving his first public response to a crisis that he, after all, helped to manufacture by sending troops to the Ukrainian border.

He warned that Nato ran the risk of sucking Russia into an all out war.

The war of words has been stepped up, a real war is still on hold.

Also entering the fray by spending an away day in Kyiv was Boris Johnson.

Yesterday he was a potential suspect in a domestic police inquiry, today heâ€™s on the world stage.
