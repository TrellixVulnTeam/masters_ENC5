SAINSBURY'S and Tesco have reportedly cancelled food deliveries after snow and ice warnings across much of the UK.

The supermarket giants were forced to halt deliveries as parts of the UK were hit by a blanket of snow and temperatures plunged to -10C in places.

The Met Office issued fresh yellow warnings for rail and road closures, power cuts and injuries with wintry showers expected to hit Northern Ireland, Scotland, northwest England and north Wales within hours.

Much of southern England and London is covered by a snow and ice warning lasting until 6am tomorrow, while a warning for snow in the midlands, northeast England and eastern Scotland starts tonight.
