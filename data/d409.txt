An air traffic control center that serves Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport was closed for several hours on Wednesday for cleaning after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus, grounding flights at one of the world’s busiest hubs.

The disruption at the center — which handles high-altitude air traffic for most of North Texas, northwest Louisiana, eastern New Mexico and the southern parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas — caused ripples of delays and diverted flights across the country.

The Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center suspended operations from 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. so the facility could be disinfected, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, which said on Wednesday night that a unique confluence of events and bad weather had led to the disruption.

The F.A.A. said the employee had last worked at the center on Christmas Day, which was within a seven-day window that required a deeper level of cleaning in the areas where the employee might have been.
