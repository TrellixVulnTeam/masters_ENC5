MOSCOW, February 2. /TASS/. Gennady Lisovichenko, the ex-chief executive of the Antipinsky Oil Refinery, was detained in Italy and the Russian side was notified about the fact, a source in law enforcement agencies told TASS.

"Ex-chief executive of the Antipinsky Refinery Gennady Lisovichenko, who was wanted internationally on charges of abusing his authority, was detained in Italy in January. Russian law enforcement authorities were notified about the fact of the detention and a request for his extradition is being prepared now," the source said.
