MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan wants to hear what the state’s fifth and sixth graders think about environmental issues.

On Monday Donovan announced that he would hold the second Earth Day Essay Challenge, that will run from Feb. 14 through April 1.

Fifth and sixth graders are encouraged to be creative and write about their thoughts on Earth Day and Vermont’s environment.

Last year the office received 60 submissions from across the state.

“Last year’s essays reminded us just how much young Vermonters care about the environment," Donovan said in a statement. “We heard how these students want to take action to protect Vermont’s green mountains and forests, wildlife, clean air, and clean water.”

All submissions will be posted on the Attorney General’s Office’s website on Earth Day 2022, April 22. Posted essays will include a participant’s first name only, along with their school and grade.

Members of the Attorney General’s Environmental Protection Division will read all essays and will provide individual feedback to each student who submits an essay if the student would like to receive the feedback.
