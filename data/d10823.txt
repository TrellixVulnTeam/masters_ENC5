The case has raised questions of whether more could have been done to prevent Bethany and DJ's deaths. This was not a case where their killer was unknown to authorities. A year before he met Bethany, Boulton's relationship with another woman ended due to an act of domestic violence. He was prosecuted for battery. Boulton had racked up other offences too. Assaulting police officers in 2011 and 2016, hitting someone over the head with a vodka bottle and demanding a man hand over his phone at knifepoint.
