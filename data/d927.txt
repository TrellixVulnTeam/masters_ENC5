le Gunnar Solskjaer has plenty of options as Manchester United begin 2021 with a tough test against Aston Villa on New Year’s Day.

2020 ended on a high for United despite their Champions League exit, with the Red Devils just three points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool with a game in hand over Jurgen Klopp’s champions.

Marcus Rashford sealed a late 1-0 win over Wolves at Old Trafford to round off the year, though United struggled for inspiration throughout and have found things tough at home this season.

Solskjaer would ideally like to rotate ahead of next week’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Man City, but with Dean Smith’s Villa in fine form, United are likely going to have to be at full strength for the Villans’ visit.

Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones remain sidelined, while Victor Lindelof’s back injury means Eric Bailly is likely to continue at centre-back alongside Harry Maguire.

Fred and Scott McTominay were both on the bench against Wolves but should return in midfield, with Paul Pogba potentially rested.

With Mason Greenwood not in the best form, Dan James could be given another run-out, while Anthony Martial may come in for Edinson Cavani with the Uruguayan being prepared for City.
