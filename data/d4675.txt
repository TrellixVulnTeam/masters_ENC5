A PUB boss found a pint of Stella Artois lived up to its “Reassuringly Expensive” slogan when he was fined £3,000 for serving it in lockdown.

Michael Bishop, 42, was caught out by undercover trading standards officers on Valentine’s Day last year and again in March.

At the time, Covid rules covering the Angel Inn, in Maesycwmmer, Caerphilly, South Wales, meant customers could not be served inside.

Tim Keohane, from Trading Standards, said: “We had received information that he was contravening coronavirus regulations.”

Bishop, who lives in the village, admitted breaking the Covid rules as well as a Licensing Act offence at Newport magistrates’ court.

He must pay a £1,400 fine, £1,500 in costs and a £140 victim surcharge
