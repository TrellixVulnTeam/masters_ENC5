Mesut Ozil, Sead Kolasinac, Sokratis and Shkodran Mustafi are all free to leave Emirates Stadium and Arteta has confirmed some players will leave on loan.

Arsenal have been linked with a move for Real Madrid star Isco, and Arteta has said he is open to bringing players in if the right opportunity presents itself.

Arteta said: “We have a large squad. We knew that, and a lot of things that happened in the summer we could not accomplish them for different reasons. There are some players who are going to go on loan, they are going to leave. That is the priority at the moment.

“We cannot sustain the numbers that we have in certain positions. We are looking to do that and then we will see if we have the right opportunity in the positions where we need some more help. We are working with the club to try to do that as well."

Kolasinac is closing in on a loan move to his former club Schalke, with Arsenal set to pay a portion of his wages. Arteta would not confirm the Bosnian’s potential departure but said: “We are working on a couple of things.

“There are some conversations around a few players and whether we can find some loans, because the numbers we have in the squad at the moment are really big.”

Arteta also said it is important any new arrivals in January do not stifle opportunities for young players like Emile Smith Rowe.

“Obviously financially, it is not just us it is every club in the country. We are going to have to add somehow if we want to improve the team in different ways, and we will decide whether we will do loans or buying players in relation to the opportunity that we have.”
