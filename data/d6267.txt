On Friday, we were presented with the hot rumor that Seventies pop star Barry Manilow sided with Neil Young in pulling his songs from Spotify over Joe Rogan. When we recorded, it seemed true. But by mid-afternoon, Manilow tweeted it wasn't true. I thought it didn't exactly seem like his move...and it wasn't.

This kind of controversy lines up with our interview with Christian Toto about his new book on politically correct entertainment, Virtue Bombs: How Hollywood Got Woke and Lost Its Soul. He reports "Hollywoodâ€™s Dream Factory is now a nightmare of woke restrictions, Identity Politics run amok, and freedom-snuffing rules and regulations."

We discuss the decline and fall of movie critics, independent movies made by conservatives (like the Daily Wire), Gina Carano's cancellation from Disney, ABC's black-ish, and Jimmy Fallon going to the woodshed.
