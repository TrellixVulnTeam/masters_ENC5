TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) â€” The Florida House passed a bill to redraw legislative districts on Wednesday. The bill now goes back to the Senate, which approved its chamber's new maps last week.

Unlike the Senate, where some Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the newly drawn 40 Senate districts, House Democrats opposed the bill once it was amended to add the 120 redrawn House districts. The bill passed on a 77-39 vote.

Democrats said there wasn't enough public input, and the maps didn't take into consideration the growth of minority populations.

Legislative districts are redrawn every 10 years after the federal census.
