It is a question that has plagued the pandemic, sparking furious debate over Britain’s dinner tables. Is coronavirus really any more deadly than flu?

Before the vaccine roll-out and omicron surge, the answer was undoubtedly: “yes”.

Even at the end of December, the rolling seven-day Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for coronavirus was about 0.3 per cent or one death in 333 cases, based on a 21-day lag between testing and death.

In comparison, the death rate for flu sits somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent - or between one death in 1,000 and one death in 500.

It was previously much worse. In May 2020, the Covid case fatality rate peaked as high as 15 per cent - one death in six cases - although this was largely fuelled by lack of testing - but it is fair to say that throughout the pandemic coronavirus has been far deadlier than flu.

However, the situation has changed dramatically in the last few weeks. The millions of cases sparked by the omicron wave have translated into relatively few deaths, bringing an important change in the deadliness of Covid.
