A New York City ethics panel has agreed that Mayor Eric Adams can hire his brother as a senior security adviser, but only at $1 per year and with no power over department personnel, not the $240,000 salary the position was supposedly set to pay. What do you think?

“He could still make a lot of money depending on how many hundreds of thousands of years he kept the job.”

“Yeah, and it’s even less than that after taxes.”

“With a little finesse, I’m sure he could negotiate that up to $1.25.”
