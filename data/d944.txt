ikel Arteta understands Sam Allardyce’s concerns about coronavirus but says the Premier League does not need a two-week “circuit breaker” despite a sharp rise in positive Covid-19 cases at clubs.

Tottenham’s game against Fulham on Wednesday was postponed because of an outbreak of coronavirus at the west London club and, as infections soar across the country, 66-year-old West Brom manager Allardyce has said he is concerned about his health.

The Premier League have said there have been no discussions over whether to pause season.

Arteta tested positive for Covid-19 in March just before last season was suspended, but he believes the Premier League has now created a safe environment for this season to continue.

Asked if he can understand Allardyce’s concerns, Arteta said: Absolutely. “We are all concerned with our own health and with what is going on around us.

“But all the protocol that we have in place, everything that we do around the training ground, around football matches and the fact that we play outdoors, it minimises the risks a lot.

“You see the records since we started to test, it is incredibly positive and I think as long as we can we have to carry on doing that, obviously without putting anyone at risk.

“But I think we have shown the system is working. OK in the last week or so something has happened, I think we are going to have more restrictions and more tests to try to be as efficient as we were before. And we will see. I think it can work and we can carry on.”
