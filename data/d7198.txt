Tiger Roll is among 107 entries for the Grand National at Aintree on April 9.

The winner in 2018 and 2019, Gordon Elliott's charge was denied a possible hat-trick bid in 2020 due to the pandemic and owners Gigginstown House Stud decided against running in 2021.

Last year's winner Minella Times could try to repeat the feat that saw Rachael Blackmore become the first female rider to take the world's most famous steeplechase.

Any Second Now, trained by Ted Walsh, is another leading fancy having finished third in 2021.

The horses who finished fourth to eighth respectively - Burrows Saint, Farclas, Blaklion, Discorama and Jett - could also try again, while Cloth Cap, who was pulled up last April when sent off favourite, is on the list once more.

The longlist will be cut until the final field of 40 is confirmed a couple of days before the Aintree race.

Here is the current longlist:
• Any Second Now (IRE) 10 Mr John P. McManus Ted Walsh Ireland
• Go Another One (IRE) 10 Ms Caroline Ahearn John McConnell Ireland
• Off You Go (IRE) 9 Mr John P. McManus Charles Byrnes Ireland
• Time To Get Up (IRE) 9 Mr John P. McManus Jonjo O'Neill
• Two For Gold (IRE) 9 May We Never Be Found Out Partnership 2 Kim Bailey
