BAMBOO has reportedly caused more than £100,000 worth of damage at a house after growing through the floor.

Hundreds of metres of bamboo runners burst through the four-bed home in Eastleigh, emerging in the living room, study, hall and kitchen.

Thought to have come from a neighbouring property, the hardy plant penetrated the floor after growing under the concrete foundation.

The plant had started to grow through the cavity walls of the property.

Experts had to break up the concrete floor so the bamboo could be removed, with the owners reportedly putting in a £100,000 insurance claim.

The residents declined to speak to the Echo but Nic Seal, from invasive plant specialist Environet UK, said it was the “worst case” he had seen.

“Through no fault of their own, the homeowners have suffered significant financial cost, stress and inconvenience, being required to vacate their home for several months,” he said.

“The truth is, most bamboos are invasive if planted directly into the ground and left to their own devices. It’s unfortunate that bamboo is still sold at garden centres and plant nurseries around the country with little warning about the risks.

“It would be a good deal less popular if people realised that within a few years they could be dealing with an extensive infestation that can spread across boundaries into neighbouring properties resulting in legal disputes and serious damage to homes which can be extremely costly to repair.”

The modern detached house was built around 15 to 20 years ago and is said to be worth in the region of £650,000 to £700,000.

Experts warn that running bamboo can be more damaging than Japanese knotweed as its roots can travel more than 30ft.
