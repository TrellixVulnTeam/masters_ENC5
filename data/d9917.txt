MANCHESTER UNITED finished the January transfer window with NO new signings - and now look ahead to the summer window.

Top of that list could be Declan Rice, who now has just two and a half years left on his West Ham contract.

Meanwhile, loanee Anthony Martial has begun training at his new club Sevilla.

Another striker who could join Martial in the exit door is Edinson Cavani, who has been heavily linked with a move to River Plate this summer.

And Donny van de Beek is off, having signed a loan deal with Frank Lampard's Everton.
