Property buyers fearing upcoming interest rate rises have flocked to 10-year mortgages in the last month.

The number of home purchasers taking out 10-year fixed-rate loans has more than tripled since December, as panicked buyers have raced to lock in cheap rates.

There was a 216pc jump in the number of buyers taking out 10-year mortgages last week, compared to a month ago, according to analysis by Twenty7Tec, a mortgage data firm.

This trend towards longer-term loans has continued at the start of this week, the company said. Compared to last year, Twenty7Tec said the number of buyers taking out 10-year loans had increased by 150pc.

The surge in demand meant 10-year loans accounted for 4.5pc of the mortgage market in the last week of January. This was nearly triple the rate recorded this time last year.

The growing interest in 10-year fixes comes as expectation mounts for the Bank of England to increase the Bank Rate by a further 0.25 percentage points tomorrow, a move which will further push up mortgage costs.

This rise would bring the Bank Rate up to 0.5pc and would be the first of four rises this year, according to a forecast by consultancy Capital Economics. It expects the rate will reach 1.25pc by the end of 2022.
