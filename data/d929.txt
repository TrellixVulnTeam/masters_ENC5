anchester United continue their pursuit of Premier League leaders Liverpool on New Year's Day as they welcome Aston Villa.

Despite crashing out of the Champions League group stages, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United ended 2020 on a high domestically after Liverpoolâ€™s draw at Newcastle.

The Red Devils sit three points behind Jurgen Klopp's League leaders with a game in hand, and look capable of mounting a potential title challenge if results continue to go their way.

Still, United needed a late deflected goal from Marcus Rashford to see off a stubborn Wolves side last time out at Old Trafford, and their poor form there has been in stark contrast to their superb away results.

United's home struggles could play into the hands of a Villa side who are looking increasingly impressive, with boss Dean Smith eyeing up European football as opposed to a relegation battle.

The match will be held behind closed doors at Old Trafford due to coronavirus restrictions.

Solskjaer is likely to be without Victor Lindelof once again, so Eric Bailly should continue alongside Harry Maguire.

Fred and Scott McTominay could return in midfield, with Luke Shaw and Anthony Martial also likely to start.

As for Villa, Tyrone Mings will be available after suspension, while Ross Barkley is on the comeback trail.

Even though both teams will be worse for wear following a gruelling festive fixture run, this promises to be an entertaining game full of goals. Sitting back and breaking looks Villa's best bet for the win, but they could take the game to United - and that will suit the hosts.
