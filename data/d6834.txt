IS might have been defeated on the battlefield, but the terror group still has the capacity to shock and its threat is far from over, says Martin Chulov

An attack on a prison in northern Syria by Islamic State fighters led to a six-day siege that marked the terror group’s most dramatic stand since the collapse of its ‘caliphate’ nearly three years ago. Kurdish forces that ran the prison retook control, but not before intense clashes claimed the lives of nearly 40 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces and about 30 jihadists.

The attempted prison break showed that, however diminished they are, IS forces retain the capacity to shock. But the episode also revealed something else. Among those held in the Syrian prison were foreigners, many of them teenagers. One 17-year-old Australian boy, whose family in Sydney had not heard from him in years, got his hands on a phone and managed to send out a few terrified messages.

As the Guardian’s Martin Chulov tells Michael Safi, the situation in Syrian jails is fast becoming unsustainable. With western governments unwilling to facilitate the return of their citizens, some inmates are stuck in limbo at a growing risk of further radicalisation. It reminds Chulov of the conditions at a prison in Iraq that first gave rise to IS after the western invasion more than a decade ago.
