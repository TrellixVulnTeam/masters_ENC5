The crisis is prompting some fed-up Tory MPs to stick their head above the parapet to call for the prime minister to go.

HuffPost UK will keep you up-to-date with the running total of Conservative MPs who want the prime minister to resign.

A number of other Conservative MPs have suggested he should consider his position or been highly critical.

What Is A Letter Of No Confidence And How Many Are Needed To Trigger A Vote?

A Conservative leadership contest could be triggered if 15 per cent of MPs write to the chairman of the powerful backbench 1922 committee saying they no longer have confidence in Johnson.

No-one really knows how many MPs have submitted letters because Brady keeps them a closely guarded secret. MPs are free to publicly announce whether or not they are putting in a letter.

“It sounds to me, I am afraid, very much as though politically the prime minister is a dead man walking.”

“I don’t want to be in this position, but I am in this position now, where I don’t think he can continue as leader of the Conservatives.”

“He looks like a liability and I think he either goes now, or he goes in three years’ time at a general election.”

“Boris Johnson’s position is now untenable...his resignation is the only way to bring this whole unfortunate episode to an end.”

“I can no longer support the PM. His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues.”

“I cannot reconcile the pain and sacrifice of the vast majority of the British public during lockdown with the attitude and activities of those working in Downing Street.”
