FEEDING hungry and growing kids can be an exhausting task – especially when they’re fussy or don't know what they want.

That’s why one mother created a system to ensure her kids never ask for snacks again - and revealed exactly how she did it.

“As a mom of four, I’m professional at coming up with little tips that make your life so much easier,” the mom, Shannon Doherty, said at the beginning of her step-by-step guide.

She then revealed that she has a “self-serve fridge” that allows her children to grab a snack without needing to communicate with her about it.

Describing how to accomplish this, she said: “Slice fruit and veggies early in the week.

“Fill them in these reusable pickle containers – they fit perfectly in the fridge door.”

Shannon added that she also puts yogurt and cheese sticks in the containers as well.

Instead of putting milk, dressings, and other bottled items in the shelves that are attached to the back of the fridge door, she places the snacks there.

“I keep everything at reach so my family can grab snacks when they want them,” she explained.

She concluded: “They love the independence and so will you.”

In the comment section of her video, Shannon said the abovementioned strategy is one of her “favorite hacks of all time” and is “life-changing.”

It seems several of her followers would agree, as one commented: “Love love love your family healthy self serve fridge … it’s so fun & easy to enjoy.”

“OMG YESS THAT'S A SUCH A GREAT IDEA,” another gushed.

“I’m definitely going to Target for those pickle jars.

“[I love you] thank u for these ideas.”

Another mother previously shared a tip that had the same goal – but instead of stationary jars, she packed her kids bento boxes for snacking on the go.

And for kids who are too picky to even snack, a mom and dietician revealed her simple trick for getting her kids to enjoy their food.
