Barcelona have confirmed the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and revealed his contract has a €100m (£83.5m) buyout clause and a break option.

The forward’s deal runs to June 2025 but with an option to agree a departure in June 2023 – when his Arsenal contract that was terminated on Monday had been due to expire.

Aubameyang will earn about £2.1m over his first five months at Barcelona, whereas at Arsenal – who paid a settlement to end his contract – he would have received about £6m across the same period. His salary is due to rise from next season when the club’s financial position should be more healthy.

The 32-year-old trained with his new teammates for the first time on Tuesday as the squad prepare for Sunday’s game at home to Atlético Madrid.

Aubameyang had earlier said the manner of his departure from Arsenal “hurts” and insisted he was always “100% focused and committed” at the club.

He wrote on Instagram: “To the Arsenal fans, Thank you for making London home for myself and my family for the past four years. We went through ups and downs together and your support meant everything to me.

“Having the chance to win trophies and the honour of being the captain of this club is something I will forever keep in my heart. I have always been 100 per cent focused and committed on doing everything I can for this club which is why leaving without a real goodbye hurts – but that is football.

“I’m sad I did not get the chance to help my teammates in the last few weeks, but I have nothing but respect for this club and truly wish all my guys and the fans all the best and many successful years in the future!”

Aubameyang last played for Arsenal in early December after being stripped of the captaincy for disciplinary reasons. The manager, Mikel Arteta, said the Gabon international had failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club.
