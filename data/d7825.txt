Kids are innocent souls that need care and protection, but they might also be wild and wilful tearaways that terrorize their parents. This is what makes parenting a tough challenge filled with moments of confusion, cluelessness, exhaustion, and sometimes an utter loss of sanity.

We at Bright Side decided to share the struggle of 27 parents with a touch of humor in the hopes of bringing a smile to your face and showing other parents that they are not in this alone.

Has your kid ever put you through confusing or troublesome situations? Weâ€™d love you to share with us.
