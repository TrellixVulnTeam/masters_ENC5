National Highways figures show the Dover Traffic Access Protocol (TAP) has already been used 18 times in 2022, compared to 69 times in total last year. A key factor in delays is the requirement of French customs officials asking for "wet" signatures on documents, according to business chiefs.

William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, told The Telegraph: "Like many of the problems this looks to be down to a differing interpretation of how the trade arrangements work after leaving the EU. It is the latest in a string of issues with the trade deal that speaks to the wider problems of interpretation, inconsistent application and glaring gaps in its coverage."

Under TAP lorries are confined to 40mph and can only use the inside lane of the A20 approaching Dover. Rod McKenzie, a spokesman for the Road Haulage Association, told Sky News: "The test will be if these queues and other issues subside as traders get used to the red tape. If they continue for much longer it suggests the problems may be more serious than just teething trouble."
