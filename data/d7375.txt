RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) â€” A data scientist and former Peace Corps volunteer has joined the North Carolina House, succeeding longtime Rep. Susan Fisher of Asheville.

Rep. Caleb Rudow was the choice of Buncombe County Democratic activists to serve out the remainder of Fisher's two-year term. Gov. Roy Cooper then appointed Rudow, as state law required. Rudow was sworn in on Tuesday.

Fisher, who joined the House in 2004, resigned effective Monday. Fisher had announced her decision to step down in late November.

Rudow said he intends to run for a full two-year term, beginning with the primary set for May 17.

An Asheville native, Rudow graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Texas at Austin. He served with the Peace Corps in Zambia for over three years.
