AN EXPECTING mum was left heartbroken after throwing a huge baby shower and over 30 people rsvp’d and only seven showed up.

TikTok user @wifeylycious shared photos of the lavish occasion, where she’d set up tables, a large buffet and little gifts for all the guests.

Many of the guests didn’t even say they weren’t coming, and she shared some of the text excuses they gave the following day when she reached out.

Some had guests unexpectedly arrive and one even blamed having a dog.

The mum-to-be revealed the photos she had taken with her partner looking excited as they drove to the event - unaware that people were about to bail.

Showing snaps from the empty event, she said: “My husband saving the day playing games since we don’t have enough participants.

“He always makes sure I’m happy no matter what.”

She added that at the end of the day, what matters is her “little angel” baby, and said in the comments: “I was sad that a lot of no show up but the important people are there so I just look at it like that.”

Many people were quick to support her in the comments, with one saying: “Same thing happened to me. It was embarrassing honestly.”
