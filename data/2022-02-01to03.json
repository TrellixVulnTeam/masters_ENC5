Die Bezirksstaatsanwältin von Fulton County im Bundesstaat Georgia wandte sich Medienberichten zufolge an die Bundespolizei FBI.\n\n»Wir müssen zusammenarbeiten, um die Sicherheit der Öffentlichkeit zu gewährleisten und sicherzustellen, dass es in Atlanta nicht zu einer ähnlichen Tragödie kommt wie im Kapitol am 6. Januar 2021«, zitierten am Montag mehrere US-Medien aus einem Brief der Staatsanwältin Fani Willis.\n\nDie Staatsanwältin ermittelt gegen Trump wegen des Vorwurfs der unzulässigen Wahlbeeinflussung. Hintergrund ist unter anderem ein Anruf des damals schon abgewählten Präsidenten mit dem für die Wahlen in Georgia zuständigen Staatssekretär Brad Raffensperger Anfang Januar 2021. Trump forderte Raffensperger damals unverhohlen auf, genügend Stimmen für seinen Wahlerfolg in dem Bundesstaat zusammenzubringen. Der Republikaner weigert sich weiterhin, seine Niederlage bei der Wahl vom November 2020 einzuräumen.\n\nTrump sprach am Wochenende in Texas von »radikalen«, »bösartigen« und »rassistischen« Staatsanwälten. Wenn diese etwas »Illegales« täten, hoffe er, »dass es in diesem Land den größten Protest geben wird, den wir je in Washington D.C., in New York, in Atlanta und anderswo hatten«. Die Staatsanwälte hätten es auf ihn abgesehen. »In Wirklichkeit sind sie nicht hinter mir her. Sie sind hinter euch her«, sagte er zu der johlenden Menge.","source":"spiegel","published_at":"2022-02-01T00:02:00-05:00","url":"https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-donald-trump-hetzt-anhaenger-in-texas-gegen-ermittler-in-georgia-auf-a-99785adb-37e5-49f1-93ac-beb719fc2351#ref=rss"},{"_id":"spiegel--2022-02-01--Mason Greenwood: Nike beendet Zusammenarbeit nach Vergewaltigungsvorwurf","title":"Mason Greenwood: Nike beendet Zusammenarbeit nach Vergewaltigungsvorwurf","content":"Der US-Sportbekleidungsriese Nike hat die Zusammenarbeit mit dem englischen Fußballprofi Mason Greenwood bis auf Weiteres beendet. Der Spieler des Premier-League-Klubs Manchester United steht im Verdacht, seine Freundin angegriffen und vergewaltigt zu haben. »Wir haben unsere Beziehung zu Mason Greenwood ausgesetzt. Wir sind zutiefst besorgt über die beunruhigenden Anschuldigungen und werden die Situation weiterhin genau beobachten«, sagte ein Nike-Sprecher gegenüber der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.\n\nGreenwoods Freundin hatte am Sonntag unter anderem ein Video, Fotos und eine Sprachnotiz bei Instagram veröffentlicht. Sie war darauf blutend sowie mit Hämatomen an Armen und Beinen zu sehen. Dazu schrieb sie: »An alle, die wissen wollen, was Mason Greenwood mir antut.« Die Bilder wurden mittlerweile wieder gelöscht. Audioaufnahmen legen zudem den Versuch Greenwoods nahe, seine Freundin gegen ihren Willen zum Sex zu zwingen. Ob es tatsächlich zu einer Vergewaltigung gekommen ist, ist derzeit noch unklar.\n\nDie Polizei von Greater Manchester gab daraufhin bekannt, ein Mann sei wegen Verdachts auf Vergewaltigung und Körperverletzung zur Befragung in Gewahrsam genommen worden. Am Montag teilten die Behörden mit, der Verdächtige sei verhaftet worden und befinde sich weiterhin in Gewahrsam. Greenwoods Arbeitgeber, Rekordmeister Manchester United, hatte bereits am Sonntag erklärt, sie seien »sich der Bilder und Anschuldigungen bewusst, die in den sozialen Medien kursieren«. Später bestätigte der Verein von Trainer Ralf Rangnick, dass Greenwood bis auf Weiteres suspendiert sei.\n\nGreenwood hat in der Premier League in dieser Saison in bisher 18 Spielen fünf Tore für United erzielt, in der Champions League kam er viermal zum Einsatz (ein Treffer). Für die englische Nationalmannschaft lief Greenwood einmal auf.","source":"spiegel","published_at":"2022-02-01T00:02:00-05:00","url":"https://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/mason-greenwood-nike-beendet-zusammenarbeit-nach-vergewaltigungsvorwurf-a-a8f80a7c-93d5-4eaa-916c-6aca20b11d2f#ref=rss"},{"_id":"talkingpointsmemo--2022-02-01--National Archives: Some Trump White House Documents Were Torn Up, Reassembled With Tape","title":"National Archives: Some Trump White House Documents Were Torn Up, Reassembled With Tape","content":"Some documents from the Trump White House that the National Archives handed over to the Jan. 6 committee were torn apart and then taped back together, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIn a statement to the Post on Monday, the National Archives confirmed that records turned over from the Trump White House “included paper records that had been torn up by former President Trump.” According to the Post, the statement was in response to a question about whether some records related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrections were ripped up and taped back together.\n\nThe Post’s report confirms Trump’s unusual — and potentially unlawful — habit of ripping presidential records into shreds and throwing them on the floor. The former president’s habit reportedly caused a great deal of trouble for records management analysts who would use Scotch tape to piece together fragments of paper that were sometimes as as small as confetti, according to a Politico report in 2018.\n\nIn the latter stages of his presidency, the former president seemed to continue defying guidelines under the Presidential Records Act. The act requires the preservation of memos, letters, notes, emails, faxes and other written communications related to a president’s official duties.\n\n“White House records management officials during the Trump Administration recovered and taped together some of the torn-up records. These were turned over to the National Archives at the end of the Trump Administration, along with a number of torn-up records that had not been reconstructed by the White House,” the National Archives said in a statement shared with the Post. “The Presidential Records Act requires that all records created by presidents be turned over to the National Archives at the end of their administrations.”\n\nAccording to the Post, it’s unclear what documents from the Trump White House that were handed over to the Jan. 6 committee were damaged. Trump, however, has sought to assert privilege over presidential diaries, schedules, appointment information, handwritten notes surrounding the events of Jan. 6 from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speeches, remarks, and more.\n\nAs of last month, the National Archives sent more than 700 pages of documents to the committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, some of which were torn up and reconstructed, according to the Post.","source":"talkingpointsmemo","published_at":"2022-02-01T00:02:00-05:00","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/national-archives-some-trump-white-house-documents-were-torn-up-reassembled-with-tape?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=national-archives-some-trump-white-house-documents-were-torn-up-reassembled-with-tape"},{"_id":"tass--2022-02-01--Fifth batch of US weaponry arrives in Ukraine","title":"Fifth batch of US weaponry arrives in Ukraine","content":"KIEV, February 1. /TASS/.
