THE Army is seeking out a neo-Nazi soldier after a swastika was daubed on a barracks wall.

The graffiti appeared on Holocaust Memorial Day on Thursday and was reported by soldiers from 23 Parachute Engineers.

The Royal Military Police is investigating at Rock Barracks in Suffolk, home to troops from 16 Air Assault Brigade, the Army’s rapid reaction corps.

An Army spokesman said: “We utterly condemn any form of anti-Semitism and are extremely proud of our service personnel from the Jewish community.”

It comes after The Sun revealed every soldier will be ordered to spend a day reflecting on culture and inclusivity.

At least 16 members of the Armed Forces have been investigated for extremism since 2019, mostly for links to far-right groups, MoD figures show.

Kris Kearns, a former paratrooper, was active in the National Action group before it was banned and he founded the Fascist Fitness movement.

And ex-Army driver Dean Morris, 34, was jailed for 18 years last year for eight terror offences and two counts of possessing explosives.

Nick Lowles, head of the anti-fascist campaign group Hope Not Hate, accused commanders of not doing enough to crack down on extremists.

He said: “The threat of far-right extremism is a huge problem in Britain today.”
