THE 25 best jobs in the UK for 2022 have been revealed - and you could get paid up to £73,000 for them.

Global jobs website Glassdoor listed the best jobs Brits could bag based on hundreds of thousands of reviews of jobs listed on its website.

Which jobs came out on top ranked highly on salary and job satisfaction - and computer geeks came out on top.

Being a Java developer came out on top - which is where workers develop and build a specific kind of software.

It got a job satisfaction rating of 4.1 out of 5, and you'll get paid a healthy £55,381 on average - there were 1,567 jobs open for this kind of role around the country in December, when the data was collected.

While being an enterprise architect came in second - which is where workers use tech tools to roll out a company's business strategy.

This was the highest paying role listed on the list at a whopping £73,898, but there are less roles available - 1,328 were listed at the end of last year on Glassdoor.

While being a product manager - where you develop new products for your company - was listed as the third best job to have.

You'll get £60,656 on average for this role, and it ranked 4.1 out of 5 on job satisfaction - but again, less roles are available compared to others, with 1,432 vacancies listed last year.

Next up was a full stack engineer, who are software developers, which you'll get an average of £47,320 a year for, with data scientist roles following behind.

This role means you break down large sets of data, and you'll get an average of £49,449 doing this.

At the bottom of the list was being a procurement agent - which is where you buy things on behalf of your business so it can run more smoothly.

You'll get £46,860 for doing this job, but it ranked a 4 out of 5 on job satisfaction - and a lot fewer vacancies were open at the end of last year for the role at 783.

Second from the bottom was being a consultant - where you provide professional advice - where you'll get £46,215 a year on average.

While being a delivery manager - who makes sure products and services are delivered smoothly - will bank you £53,892 but ranked 3.9 out of 5 for job satisfaction.

Here's the full list of Glassdoor's 25 best jobs for 2022 - and how much you'll get paid for them:

It comes as the number of unemployed Brits has fallen, with staff numbers above levels seen in February 2020 before the pandemic.

But while more people are in work, wages aren't on the rise.

The latest data on pay rises suggest wages are going up by 4.2% at most, which is less than inflation, currently at 5.1%.

This will become even more of a problem, with inflation expected to rise to 6% by the Spring.

It means families will be under pressure to make their cash stretch to cover big bills hikes from energy to food.

Some 16 million households on the average £1,277-per-year price cap deal are braced for mega increases to around £1,900 that will kick in from April.

While supermarket staples from milk to eggs are all rising in price.
