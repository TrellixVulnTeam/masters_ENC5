A British Airways jet was forced to abort its landing when it got into difficulty in high winds at Heathrow.

Footage has emerged of the moment the plane balances precariously on one wheel before its tail plunges and appears to almost hit the tarmac.

It is thought the landing was affected by the weather as the country was battered by Storm Corrie on Monday morning.

The jet had made the trip between Aberdeen and London and the pilot appeared in control during its short approach, despite the gusts.

However a clip from the live streaming service Big Jet TV shows it suddenly lean heavily to the side as the pilot fights to regain control.

Its tail spins towards the ground before the jet takes off into the air again, avoiding potential disaster.

Flight records show the jet later landed safely at 11.58am, having initially been scheduled to come in at 11.43am.

Big Jet TV commented that the pilot ‘deserves a medal’ for averting a crash.

It came as the 92mph winds were recorded due to the storm, the second to hit the country in 48 hours.

In Scotland, a total of 115,847 households lost power as a result of both storms, with all but around 7,000 reconnected on Monday evening.

A nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire and a 60-year-old woman in Aberdeen died after the strong winds tore down trees on Saturday.

British Airways has been contacted for comment about the incident.
