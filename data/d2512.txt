Many commuters were stuck at their workplaces on Jan. 26 as a result of the snow, staying there or at a nearby hotel for the night. Carolyn Hallman, an office supervisor, tried to take the usual 35-minute bus trip from her workplace on Wacker Drive to her home. After waiting 1 hour and 30 minutes to find a bus, she was standing on it for 2 hours and 40 minutes. And then, the bus stopped to help a car stuck in the snow so she walked the final five minutes to her residence. In total, it took her more than four hours to get between work and home.
