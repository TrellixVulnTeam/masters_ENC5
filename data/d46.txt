PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG's deadline day move from Arsenal to Barcelona is complete.

The Gabon striker has signed on a PERMANENT move - not a loan. Aubameyang is taking a significant pay cut to join the La Liga giants.

Aubameyang, 32, shocked everyone when he arrived at Barcelona airport this morning.

It has also been revealed by the Spanish press that the plan was initially for Samuel Umtiti to move to the Emirates in return for the Gabonese star.

The loan swap was reportedly agreed and ready to go before Umtiti got injured two weeks ago.
