CHARLES and Camilla have a roaring good time as they help celebrate the Chinese New Year.

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall — wearing red to bring good fortune — joined the party in London’s Chinatown yesterday to usher in the Year of the Tiger.

They wrote a Chinese symbol for “harmony” and Charles bashed a drum as lions danced.

The visit was designed as a boost to the community, whose businesses have suffered in Covid lockdown and whose members have endured rising racist abuse as a result of the pandemic.

Camilla wore a red dress by Fiona Clare, the colour symbolising good luck in the Lunar New Year, and both were draped in a red scarf as acrobats performed.

They took part in a traditional ceremony to "awaken" two dancing lions by painting eyes, tongue and spine, on two larger-than-life lion puppets.
