Credit card rewards can be confusing – between monthly rotating categories, complicated points guides and reams of fine print, getting the most out of your credit card can almost seem like it’s more trouble than it’s worth.

Luckily, there’s a card out there that features not only an incredibly user-friendly rewards program, but also one that has one of the most consistent cash back packages on the market: the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card.

The Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card is a standout card because of its straightforward but substantial cash rewards. Cardholders earn 1.5% Cash Back on every purchase, every day. No matter where you shop, you’ll always be earning cash back on the purchases you make day-in and day-out. And while that may seem simple, there are a several other benefits that make it one of the most flexible rewards programs on a cash back card:
• No rotating categories or sign-ups. The Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card offers 1.5% Cash Back on every purchase every day – nothing else required.
• Cash back won’t expire for the life of the account. So long as you’re a cardholder, your cash back is yours to earn and spend without having to worry about an expiration date.
• There’s no limit on earnings. Since you’ll be earning rewards regardless of where you shop, cash back will be adding up fast.
• No minimums for redemption. Unlike some other cards that make you wait until you’ve reached a certain cash back threshold to access your rewards, you can redeem your cash back at any time with the Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card.

Plus, there’s even more cash back on the table with this card’s excellent sign-up bonus: if you’re a new card holder, you’ll earn a one-time $200 cash bonus after you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months from account opening. And since this card has no annual fee, there won’t be any additional costs cutting into that bonus cash.

0% Intro APR on Purchases for Over a Year

The Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card isn’t just an amazing rewards card – it’s also an excellent choice if you’re looking for flexibility to pay off purchases over time without monthly interest charges piling up. Cardholders get an APR of 0% intro on purchases for 15 months and then 14.99% - 24.99% (Variable) APR once that intro period is up.

 

 If you’re expecting a large expense or a big-ticket purchase coming up, that gives you more than a year to cover it without accumulating a mountain of additional fees. After all, why pay interest when you don’t have to?

While this card might not have the highest cash back percentage for specific categories or the biggest sign-up bonuses, it’s without a doubt one of the most well-rounded cards out there and well-worth the spot in your wallet.
