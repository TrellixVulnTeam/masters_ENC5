The Biden administration will be deploying 3,000 U.S. troops to European countries in an effort to beef up security around Ukraine as tensions continue to escalate with Russia reportedly threatening to invade the Eastern European nation’s borders.

According to The Wall Street Journal, a senior military official told the paper that “Biden is sending roughly 2,000 troops from Fort Bragg, N.C., to Poland and Germany this week and repositioning about 1,000 troops that are part of a Germany-based infantry Stryker squadron to Romania, on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s eastern flank closest to Russia.”

Additionally, a senior Biden administration official told Fox News that “At the President’s direction and following Secretary Austin’s recommendation, the Department of Defense will reposition certain Europe-based units further east, forward deploy additional U.S.-based units to Europe, and maintain the heightened state of readiness of response forces to meet these commitments.”

“These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are not permanent moves. They respond to current conditions,” that official added, according to Fox News.

The decision was reportedly made on Tuesday.
