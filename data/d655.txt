The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.14% lower on New Year's Eve after a shorter trading session. London's FTSE index, which closes shortly, looks set to close 1.2% lower on the final day that the U.K. is a de-facto member of the EU's single market and customs union before Brexit is definitively implemented.

U.K. banks, retailers and home builders were among the stocks trading lower Thursday, with sentiment likely affected by both Brexit uncertainty and further restrictions on public life announced by the U.K. government on Wednesday due to the rate of coronavirus infection.
