The couple were spotted holding hands as they entered The Ivy in Manchester.

Jones and Khan spent the night in the venue's VIP section to celebrate the midfielder's special day.

The Reds ace became Instagram official with his model girlfriend last year in May but it is still unknown how long they have been dating.

Jones had been sidelined following a freak eye injury and a bout with Covid-19 but started in the Merseysiders' last two matches.

The England Under-21 international was praised by Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who also urged him to push himself in order to develop even further.

Klopp said after last month's win over Arsenal in the Carabao Cup: "Yes, Curtis was really good the last two games. I know him for a long time now and I am one of his biggest fans.

"From when I first saw him I can remember the talent group training at Melwood on a side pitch and I looked out of my office and saw him and it was 'Ooof. Wow'.

"The next question was 'How old is he?' I think he was 15 at the time but was already clearly a massive talent.

"Talents need to work and he is doing that work and talents need to learn the game and he is doing that every day.

"Sometimes they need a push and Curtis looks like he is that guy – not that he is not concentrating.

"It is a proper response and if his response is like this then absolutely fine."
