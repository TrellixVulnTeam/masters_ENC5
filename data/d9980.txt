A man murdered his ex-girlfriend and her autistic son after fearing the child’s condition would affect their baby, a court has heard.

Daniel Boulton, 30, repeatedly stabbed Bethany Vincent, 26, and Darren Henson, her nine-year-old son, after walking 28 miles to their house in Louth, Lincolnshire, on the evening of May 31 2021.

Boulton, a former amusement arcade worker who shared a nine-month-old son with Ms Vincent, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 40 years at Lincoln Crown Court on Wednesday.

He had a “deep hatred” of Darren and saw him as a threat to both his relationship with Ms Vincent and the upbringing of his son, the court heard.

Mr Justice Pepperall, sentencing Boulton, said: “You said that you feared his autism would in some way affect your son. You said many times to a number of different people that you wanted him dead and out of the way.

“I am sure that you targeted Darren because of a hatred motivated by his autism and your irrational fear that such a condition would somehow affect your own son.”
