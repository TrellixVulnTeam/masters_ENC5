At her daily briefing, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, was asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s latest comments on the crisis in Ukraine.

Earlier today, Putin complained that the US and its allies are ignoring Russia’s security demands, as the Kremlin works on a response to the White House’s proposal on Ukraine.

Psaki said that, while it is important to “keep the door to diplomacy open,” the US will continue to stand by Ukraine as Russia threatens its sovereignty by building up its troop presence along Ukrainian borders.

“When the fox is screaming from the top of the henhouse that he’s scared of the chickens, which is essentially what they’re doing, that fear isn’t reported as a statement of fact,” Psaki said.

“And as you watch President Putin screaming about the fear of Ukraine and the Ukrainians, that should not be reported as a statement of fact. We know who the fox is in this case. We have seen the buildup of troops at the border.”

When asked about a potential path to “mutual de-escalation” in Ukraine, Psaki argued it was important to identify Russia as the “aggressor” in the situation.

“When we talk about mutual de-escalation, Russia has 100,000 troops on the border. They are the aggressor,” Psaki said. “Nato is a defensive alliance. It is not the same thing. And I think we need to be careful about comparing them as the same thing.”
