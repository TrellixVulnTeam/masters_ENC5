LEE COUNTY, Fla. – Hundreds of people set up camp across Lee County Tuesday night to wait in line for a COVID-19 vaccine Wednesday morning.

As of 6:30 a.m., all three vaccination sites in Lee County have hit capacity. The afternoon sessions of vaccines are closed as the allotted doses have been assigned.

Vaccinations are scheduled at three different locations:

Each site has been allotted 800 doses of the vaccine on Wednesday.

Vaccines are only for people 65 years old and older, or healthcare workers.

People started waiting in line for the vaccine as early as Tuesday morning.

90-year-old Abdulla Benkhatar has been standing in line since 10 a.m. Tuesday. He’s first in line at the North Fort Myers Rec. Center.

“It’s very difficult,” he said. “We’ve been at home for almost 10 months now. It’s really important to me, for my health, and to be able to do things I like to do and get back to normal.”

Benkhatar said he is excited to see his grandkids again.

Just south, at Lakes Regional Library, dozens started lining up Tuesday night to mark their spot in line.

People brought extra coats, chairs, blankets, and mini tents. Just before 4 a.m., it appeared there were more than 300 people waiting in line.

At Cape Coral’s Cultural Park Theater, people also lined up late Tuesday night, some waiting in their cars, even bringing RVs.

Vaccinations aren’t scheduled to begin until 9 a.m.

On Monday and Tuesday, the first days of administering the vaccine, the sites hit capacity in the early morning hours.

The Department of Health has not released details about any upcoming vaccine sites in Lee County yet.
