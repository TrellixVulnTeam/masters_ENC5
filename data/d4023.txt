The Metropolitan Police has confirmed it will be investigating alleged Downing Street parties on eight dates following the publication of the Sue Gray report's key findings.

In a statement, the Police said: "Following the publication of Sue Gray's update, we can now confirm that we will be investigating eight of the 12 dates considered by the Cabinet Office as part of their own investigation into alleged gatherings on government premises during Covid restrictions.

"Our position from the start has been that, while we donâ€™t normally investigate breaches reported long after they are said to have taken place, if significant evidence became available we would assess it.

"That is now the situation and why we have acted.

"As part of the investigation it is necessary for us to contact those who attended these events to get their account.

"As a result, the Met has requested that any information identified as part of the Cabinet Office investigation about these events, is not disclosed in detail.

"This request only applies for the duration of our investigation and does not apply to events we are not investigating.

"If following an investigation, officers believe it is appropriate, because the Covid regulations have been breached without a reasonable excuse, a fixed penalty notice would normally be issued.

"Once the penalty is paid, the matter is considered closed."
