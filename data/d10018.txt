Typhoon fighter jets were scrambled to respond to a group of Russian “bear” bombers approaching UK airspace, the RAF has confirmed.

The jets, which launched from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland, on Wednesday morning around 11am, were joined by a Voyager air-to-air refuelling tanker from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

They intercepted the two Tu-95 Bear H bomber aircraft & two Tu-142 Bear F reconnaissance aircraft, flying north of Scotland, because they were in an “UK area of interest”. However, during the five hours they were circulating they did not enter UK sovereign airspace.

Although RAF sources sought to play down the significance of the interception of the aircraft, which they said happened around 10 times a year, senior Tory MPs said the timing was crucial given the volatile situation between Russia and the UK over its threats towards Ukraine.

Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Committee, said the interception was a “classic game of cat and mouse”.

“Given the climate, this isn’t by accident. These tactics are part of a wider strategy to rattle the UK and essentially as a reminder that we cannot afford to send aircraft towards Ukraine because of threats to our airspace far closer to home,” he told The Telegraph.

“We shouldn’t be intimidated by this, it has now become standard from Russia to distract us from its wider objective of widening its sphere of influence and aligning the country closer to China.”
