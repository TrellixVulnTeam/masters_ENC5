A man has been detained after a 2-day-old baby went missing and her mother was found shot to death. The man detained was known to the victims, according to Memphis police.

Troopers, along with local and state partners, are still searching for the baby, and an AMBER alert remains in effect.

Late Tuesday night, Memphis police said officers found an abandoned vehicle in Whitehaven, Tennessee. After investigating, police found a 27-year-old woman near the car who had been fatally shot.

In a press release, Memphis police said they were told the woman had a 2-day old child Kennedy Hoyle with her, but the baby was not found in the car.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an AMBER Alert for Kennedy on Wednesday morning. The baby is 6 pounds and 17 inches long. When she was last seen, she was in the presence of her mother and wearing a black and white polka dot onesie with pink pants, according to police.

Family members told CBS affiliate WREG that they last heard from the newborn's mother, Danielle Hoyle, on Tuesday night as she was driving the baby to the hospital.

"I just want my grandbaby, and I want my daughter to come home. That's all I want. At least tell me what's going on," Hoyle's mother said. "They said they got like 50 police looking for her. My thing is everybody should be looking for her. She's a newborn"

Anyone who has seen a child fitting this description or has information about Kennedy's whereabouts is encouraged to call MPD at 901-545-2677 or TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND.
