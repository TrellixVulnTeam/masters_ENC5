Contact was made with the Italian club late on Monday but there was not enough time to complete a deal for the 30-year-old forward.

The move for Zapata followed failed attempts to bring in Benfica's Darwin Nunez, who was the subject of a club record bid from West Ham, and Jesse Lingard on loan from Manchester United once more.

The East Londoners have come through the window without a single addition to David Moyes's squad.

Moyes had wanted a central defender and a striker in order to strengthen his squad for a Champions League push, but has been left to fight on with what he has got.

Earlier in the window, approaches had been knocked back for Leeds United duo Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha, while talks over a move for Marseille defender Duje Caleta-Car also hit an impasse.

Moyes maintained throughout the window that there was a chance no new signings would arrive and that the burden to ensure the squad, which currently sits fifth and are into the last-16 of the Europa League, can continue to fight on all fronts rests with him.
