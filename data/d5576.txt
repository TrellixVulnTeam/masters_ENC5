A rich credit card continues to take the market by storm.

I don’t say this lightly: the Wells Fargo Active Cash℠ Card is easily one of the best cash back cards I’ve seen in my 15 years of finance.

But don’t just take my word for it.
• CNBC says: “Don’t miss this” ... "Over a five year period, cardholders could earn $2,415.”
• Money.com says it's: “the most cash back you can receive on…purchases with no limits and no annual fee.”

Here’s what’s getting everyone so excited:
• Unlimited 2% cash rewards— the highest flat cash back rate I’ve come across with no restrictions or hoops to jump though
• $200 cash rewards sign-up bonus that you can earn by spending just $1,000 in purchases in the first three months
• 0% intro APR for 15 months on both purchases and qualifying balance transfers

This is the first card I’ve seen that offers a best-in-class unlimited 2% cash rewards rate with no catch, and would be highly-rated based on that alone. But this card goes way beyond that. It also offers two additional highly sought-after features: a hefty $200 cash rewards sign-up bonus and a generous 0% intro APR period. I’ve simply not come across this combination of top perks in one card before.

Note: we’ve seen some credit card companies lower the welcome bonus on a card over time. While we don’t know if that’ll happen here, if you’re interested in the card we do recommend using this link to apply today to make sure you don’t miss out on the full bonus.
