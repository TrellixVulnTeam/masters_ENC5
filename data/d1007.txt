Associated Press: “It’s no surprise that unusual steps are taken to protect any president. But the strict precautions could also threaten to undercut the Biden administration’s own efforts to tell Americans — especially those who are vaccinated and boosted — that they can get on with something closer to their normal lives in the face of the omicron wave.”

“And it’s emblematic of the messaging challenges surrounding the administration’s approach to Covid-19 as the virus becomes endemic, familiar and somewhat controlled but still menacing, with hard-to-follow guidelines often unevenly implemented.”

“For months, Biden aides have fretted that the people who are most protected against Covid-19 remain the most cautious, a dynamic they view as a drag on the nation’s economic and psychological recovery.”
