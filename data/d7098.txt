A HOTEL chain is offering a free night's stay if you wine and dine in their restaurants - meaning you don't have to go far after a boozy night.

Oakman Inns is offering the promotion for the whole of February, which lets guests enjoy a free stay at any of their hotels in the UK.

Guests only need to spend £120 on food and drink in their restaurant to get the free night.

They explain on their website: "When you spend £120 on food and drink, you’ll get a relaxing night stay completely free!

"Simply book online, pay upfront… check-in any time from 3pm onwards, and begin eating and drinking your way through that £120 tab!

The deal is available from Sunday to Friday, and is on offer until the end of the month.

There are 14 Oakman Inns across the UK to choose from, including in the Lake District and Cotswolds.

We stayed at their Witney hotel The Blue Boar - this is what you can expect from the stay.

Here is the full list of hotels where you can take advantage of the great deal:

Staycations are expected to boom across the UK again this year, with cottages and holiday booking websites already seeing huge demand.

You can still find a bargain though - Haven has four-night breaks from just £49.

And Premier Inn has rooms for just £7.25 each a night.

Fancy a family holiday? Legoland has one-day park entry from £50pp during the half term.
