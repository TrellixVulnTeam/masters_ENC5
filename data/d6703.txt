The MegaDraw - which is held a few times a year - has a boosted €130 million jackpot that could be won on Friday night.

This time however, there’s something extra to get excited about that eagle-eye observers have spotted.

People yet to open a Lottoland account will get 4 bets for the price of 1* when betting on this Friday’s €130m Millionaire MegaDraw.

It costs €2.50 to place a bet on Millionaire MegaDraw, where the prize is the same as the highly-anticipated EuroMillions equivalent.

By getting 4 bets for €2.50*, Lottoland newcomers will enjoy a €7.50 discount!

It’s not every day a jackpot like the MegaDraw comes around.

The last time someone in Ireland claimed the MegaDraw top prize was in 2019, becoming the second person from Ireland to achieve the feat.

More recently, a Lottoland Ireland customer claimed a stunning €174,000 near-jackpot win with a bet on the outcome of the US Powerball jackpot.

It was not long ago since it was revealed that an octogenarian from Dublin won €174,000 from Lottoland.

He bet on the US Powerball draw, which that week had an enormous €183 million jackpot.

Agonisingly, he didn’t quite match every number drawn and ended up with a very reasonable consolation of €174,649.

"Well, I sort of do the Lotto here and different things, and then I saw Lottoland advertised and I just had a go at it, you know", he said.

"I saw a US PowerBall advertised, I said "Ah Jeez that's big, says I, sure I'll have a go of it for the fun of it.

"Just for €10, I can't believe this good news, it's unbelievable."
