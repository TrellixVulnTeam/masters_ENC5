Rishi Sunak will host a press conference on Thursday – with ‘a major announcement’ to shield families from crippling energy bills, reports say.

The address to the nation comes amid fears energy regulator Ofgem could allow suppliers to hike bills by up to 50% for the average household.

The energy sector regulator is set to unveil the results of its latest price cap review – the maximum amount that suppliers can charge the ‘average user’ – at 11am on Thursday.

Consultancy Cornwall Insight said that the 22 million households whose energy bills are tied to the price cap can expect their bills to rise to £1,915 from April.

The figure will also later go up to as much as £2,329 for the typical user in October, Consultancy Cornwall Insight predicts.

Financial support will be offered to those affected by the hikes in April, The Sun reports.

The price cap has so far been protecting households from the worst as gas prices spike around the world.

A number of energy firms have gone bust over the past few months, with warnings more could follow.

Many households are facing the ‘devastating’ choice between heating and food as their gas bills rise, according to Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis.
