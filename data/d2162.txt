A couple days ago, my kind friend George Gammon from Rebel Capitalist took the time to answer a couple of exclusive Fringe Finance questions for me. George is one of my favorite economic commentators and has been a friend of mine, and my podcast, for years. I often describe his podcast as similar to mine, just more well thought out, more educational and more useful with less childish humor.

I thought this week would be a good time to tap into George’s head, given that the last time I spoke to George was well before the current market volatility. George prepared two, twenty minute-long exclusive videos for Fringe Finance to try and tackle a list of questions I had for him.

I reviewed George's first video in this writeup for Zero Hedge, where he talked about everything from volatility in markets, to gold, to the Fed.

On Being Censored By YouTube

In his second video George talks about one of his channel's bans from YouTube: "Rebel Capitalist did get taken down by YouTube about two months ago. I actually wasn't that surprised. I looked, couldn't find it and got an email from YouTube saying they had taken down my account without any strikes or warnings."

"I went on Twitter and mentioned the YouTube email and got overwhelming support," George says. Then, after Joe Rogan re-tweeted George's tweet, his account mysteriously wound up back on YouTube.

"Maybe four hours later, Joe Rogan re-tweeted me. Then it went completely viral. About 2 hours later I got an email from YouTube saying 'Whoops! Sorry! Our mistake! We reinstated your channel!'"

It's encouraging to see competition from other social media platforms, George says. "If they continue this draconian censorship around free speech, maybe YouTube will go the way of Myspace," George says.

On Who He Follows During Market Volatility

George also explains who he listens to when the market is volatile: "Lyn Alden, I'm always paying attention to what she's doing. She's got a very very special talent, even compared to other people who are incredibly intelligent. I think Lyn is the best out there, personally. But I'm always listening to Jeff Snyder, and then I try to look at what's happening in the stock market through the lens of people I talk to."

"I try to listen to the old school guys - Chanos, Druckenmiller, Jim Rogers, Marc Faber - and kind of those old school type of guys. Gundlach, too."

"My base case is at the end of 2022, I think we'll be between 90 and 100 on the DXY," George adds when asked about whether or not the dollar would crash this year.

On The Future Of Covid And The Stock Market

"I think especially in the red states, Covid is going to be in the rearview mirror by the summer, maybe even by the spring," George says. "It is possible we have another variant, but it's unlikely, because another variant would have to be more transmissible. We'll probably be stuck with omicron for quite some time."

He continues: "Is it priced into the market? I think it is. I think Covid is still going to be a thing in other countries and some of the blue states. The tell will be what countries are still under the influence of the World Economic Forum and the global elite."

"I've seen a pivot in the mainstream media," George says. "Politicians know they can't run and win on a platform of locking you in a cage and vaccine passports and making your kids inject a foreign substance into their body. That's not a winning platform and I think the politicians are starting to realize that. Then they call the media and say 'hey, you need to do a 180'".

In George’s second video, he also talks about:
• None How lesser known content creators get screwed because they don’t have a following
• None How he has learned the global monetary system by educating others
• None Why countries closest to the World Economic Forum will likely perpetuate the Covid narrative more than others
• None Why he doesn’t think the big crash for the dollar is coming in 2022
