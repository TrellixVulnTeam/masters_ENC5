A MEDICAL trial is looking for volunteers from Southampton.

Southampton City Council is urging volunteers to come forward for the world-first trial to find antiviral medicines to treat people with Covid-19.

PANORAMIC is a UK-wide clinical study sponsored by the University of Oxford and funded by the National Institute for Health Research.

It is open to everyone with ongoing symptoms of Covid-19 and a positive PCR or lateral flow test, regardless of vaccination status. Southampton City Council said: â€œCalling on those eligible to come forward for a world-first trial to find antiviral medicines to treat people with Covid-19. Home-based study that lasts only five days and participants are free to withdraw at any time."
