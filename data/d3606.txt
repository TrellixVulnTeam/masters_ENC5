Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) again broke sharply with former President Donald Trump, telling reporters he would not support any reduced sentences for those who pled guilty in the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Axios reports.

Said McConnell: “I would not be in favor in shortening any of the sentences for any of the people who pleaded guilty to crimes.”
