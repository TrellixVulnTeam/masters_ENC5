WETHERSPOONS customers can find the cheapest pints and biggest portions of chips using a new map.

A 'Spoons fan designed the map to help punters track down the best deals, as the pub chain's prices vary at different locations.

The map is only available in London at the moment, but could help visitors find a cheap beer - especially as a pint could cost more than Â£7 in the capital as prices are set to rise.

It also tells customers where to find the biggest portions of chips after the chain was criticised for its "disappointing" servings of fries.

A student created the map using data from the Facebook group "Wetherspoons paltry chip count" and prices from the pub chain's app.

They used Carling as the benchmark beer, as it's often one of the cheapest available on tap and is sold in most pubs.

"As a procrastinating Geography student, I made a map of London Wetherspoons chip portions compared to pint prices," the creator said in a Reddit post.

"I used data from a Facebook group of people counting chips and pint prices from the Wetherspoons app."

But as it's based on crowdsourced data it might not be completely reliable.

You can find your nearest Wetherspoons branch by using the company's pub locator.

Prices are usually more expensive in city centres, with the highest prices charged in central London, and travel hubs.

Pubs in smaller towns and on the outskirts of major cities are likely to be cheaper.

The map also doesn't take special offers into account.

For example, Wetherspoon's has slashed the price of certain pints to 99p until the end of February, although are still likely to be more expensive in city centre pubs.

It also recently axed pints of John Smith and Strongbow in a big shake-up of its drinks menu.

Wetherspoons customers can save more money on meals after the chain announced changes to its popular Curry Club.
