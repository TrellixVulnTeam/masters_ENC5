COVID is declining in almost half of Southampton's neighbourhoods – but three new hotspots have emerged.

According to the latest data, 16 of the 31 districts reported an increase in cases during the seven days to January 26.

This was when compared to the previous seven days, and the remaining 15 districts reported a decrease.

But things have gone from bad to worse in Aldermoor and Lordswood, Bitterne South and Shirley Warren.

Shirley Warren currently has a case rate higher than all but one London borough (2,162.5 per 100,000 people).

It joins Bitterne South and Shirley Warren in the worst possible category, which have case rates of 1,719.6 and 1,644.2 respectively.

As a whole, Southampton reported 3,105 cases, up 218 or 7.6%. This is a case rate of 1,277.9 per 100,000 people.

Hampshire reported 17,596, an increase of 2,672 or 17.9% – increasing the case rate to 1,266.6 per 100,000 people.
