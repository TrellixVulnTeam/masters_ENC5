There’s still no immediate end in sight to the gridlock that has effectively shut down the capital since the self-proclaimed “Freedom Convoy” rolled into town over the weekend to protest vaccine mandates and other pandemic-imposed public health restrictions, but time may be about to run out on Erin O’Toole’s tenure as Conservative leader, courtesy of a caucus-triggered confidence vote set to take place today.

“Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole and his team worked furiously to salvage his leadership Tuesday, on the eve of a crucial caucus vote that some party insiders predicted he has little chance of surviving,” the Star’s Stephanie Levitz reported last night.

But while “O’Toole and some of his closest allies were working the phones” yesterday , “trying to gauge whether that majority exists … sources told the Star that his team was reaching out in some cases to MPs who have already signed on to the effort to dump him.”

The make-or-break secret ballot vote “will be held electronically during a caucus meeting Wednesday on Zoom,” and will be decided by a simple majority, with a second vote to select an interim leader to take place later that same day if necessary.

As yet, the party has offered no details on when — or how — the results will be released.

Meanwhile, both the Liberal and the New Democrat caucuses are also set to meet behind digitally closed doors this morning.

According to his itinerary, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — who announced earlier this week that he has tested positive for COVID, and is currently self-isolating — will “virtually attend” his party’s regularly-scheduled Wednesday morning confab.

He’s also planning to fire up his webcam to be cross-examined by his cross-aisle adversaries in the House of Commons this afternoon, and will speak at a virtual conference hosted by the Canadian Blank Scientists Network this evening.

For their part, the New Democrat caucus will also assemble via videoconference “to discuss how {their) party will help Canadians struggling to make ends meet,” according to a party-issued advisory. (10 AM)

Also on the parliamentary radar: Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem and senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers make a virtual appearance before the Senate BANKING, TRADE AND COMMERCE committee. (3 – 5 PM)

With the throne speech debate now officially behind them, MPs are set to begin second-reading consideration of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s latest omnibus budget bill, which was introduced just before the House shut down for the holidays, and would implement measures proposed in the fall economic statement, including the Underused Housing Tax Act, as well as new or expanded tax credits for school supplies purchased by teachers and, for “eligible businesses,” expenses related to air quality improvement.
