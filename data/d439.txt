CHILLING footage has emerged of the moment former Miss USA Cheslie Kryst fell to her death in an apparent suicide.

Kryst 30, was found dead on Sunday after falling from the 29th floor of her Midtown apartment building in New York City.

Cops believe that the former beauty queen, who lived on the ninth floor, jumped to her death.

In shocking surveillance video, which The Sun has chosen not to show, a body can be seen on the street outside of her home on Sunday.

One witness described seeing a body and blood on the block where she lived.

Scott Erik, 41, and Miles Bartelle, 30, told The Sun they saw cops outside the building on Sunday and described their shock at hearing of Kryst's death.

Erik said: "You never know what is happening behind closed doors. Even if people seem fine they might not be.

"This is a really easy city to get lost in. Check in with your people."

Another onlooker – who did not wish to be named – told The Sun on Monday: "It was crazy and very sad. I've never seen anything like it."

Pictures from the scene show cops surrounding the victim with a blue tent.

Police sources told the New York Post that Kryst left a note behind for her mom April Simpkins, who was awarded the gong of Mrs North Carolina in 2002.

She is said to have “wanted to leave everything” to her beauty pageant mom.

Following Kryst's death, a statement from the Kryst family read: "In devastation and great sorrow, we share the passing of our beloved Cheslie."

They added: "Her great light was one that inspired others around the world with her beauty and strength.

"She cares, she loved, she laughed and she shined.

"Cheslie embodied love and served others, whether through her work as an attorney or fighting for social justice, as Miss USA and as a host on Extra.

"But most importantly, as a daughter, sister, friend, mentor, and colleague – we know her impact will live on."

Hours before her death, Kryst uploaded a chilling post on Instagram of herself captioned: “May this day bring you rest and peace.”

Dozens of tributes have poured in as news of her death emerged.

American actress and 2015’s Miss USA Olivia Jordan said: “Rest peacefully sister. The world will miss you and the light you shone so bright.”

ExtraTV also took to their Instagram account to share a tribute to the late correspondent.

The organization said: “Our hearts are broken. Cheslie was not just a vital part of our show, she was a beloved part of our ‘Extra’ family and touched the entire staff.”

And the official Miss America Twitter account posted: “We are heartbroken to hear about the passing of Cheslie Kryst, Miss USA 2019.

“Cheslie was an incredible example and a role model for so many. We send our deepest condolences to her family, friends, and all those who knew her.”

She discussed her struggles with aging, her work ethic, and her search for purpose.

In the essay, she penned: “Turning 30 feels like a cold reminder that I’m running out of time to matter in society’s eyes – and it’s infuriating.”

Kryst also practiced law in both North and South Carolina, with a focus on civil litigation.

She founded the fashion blog White Collar Glam, which focused on helping women dress professionally on the job.

In 2019, she was crowned Miss North Carolina and represented the US at the Miss Universe pageant in December that year.
