Blessed are the gullible in spirit,

for theirs is the great deception.

for they will be the receptor of government cheese.

for they will inherit a van down by the river.

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for self-pity,

for they will be Bernie bros.

for they shall go broke.

for they will grow man tits and live with mommy forever.

for they shall be called useful idiots…

Blessed are those who are persecuted because of bad ideas,

for theirs is the wrong side of history.

Psalms of War: Prayers That Literally Kick Ass is a collection, from the book of Psalms, regarding how David rolled in prayer. I bet you haven’t heard these read, prayed, or sung in church against our formidable enemies — and therein lies the Church’s problem. We’re not using the spiritual weapons God gave us to waylay the powers of darkness. It might be time to dust them off and offer ‘em up if you’re truly concerned about the state of Christ’s Church and of our nation.

Also included in this book, Psalms of War, are reproductions of the author’s original art from his Biblical Badass Series of oil paintings.

This is a great gift for the prayer warriors. Real. Raw. Relevant.
