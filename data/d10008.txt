Most of us don’t give a nanosecond’s thought to eye health when we’re younger. As we age – different story. Corneas that are mottled with spidery veins and faded irises can become something of an obsession for those who suffer from them.

Along with teeth and hair, eyes are key signifiers of age and health and even the most expensive window dressing can only do so much. It’s unrealistic to aim for the clarity of babyhood, but there are things you can do to substantially improve the appearance – and in the process the health – of your eyes.

Sleep’s the obvious one – frustratingly, if it’s elusive. But just lying down with a compress soaked in cool rose water can make a difference. Far more luxurious is Hayo’u’s crystal mask, a reviving, depuffing treat that can be flipped round so you can wear it on the lower half of your face too.

More humble, but also effective, are cold cucumber slices or green tea bags. Swap some of your coffees for a quality organic green tea that’s high in disease-fighting antioxidants called catechins – drinking it will do you good and you can use the bag afterwards on your eyes.

Try the green teas from animalltea, a small British start-up that donates all profits to fund wildlife conservation (from £9.50). Research suggests catechins are among a number of antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E, lutein and zeaxanthin, that can help protect the delicate tissues of the eye from glaucoma and other eye diseases.

Other supplements that can boost eye health are omega 3 and hyaluronic acid – I’ve been taking Victoria Health’s HA capsules for the past six months and my eyes are noticeably brighter, plus I feel generally less creaky.

While the amount of water we’re meant to drink daily has been overstated (most of us don’t need two litres a day on top of the liquids we get from fruit, vegetables and soup), a 250ml glass on waking up works miracles, followed up by a glass with every meal and every glass of alcohol.
