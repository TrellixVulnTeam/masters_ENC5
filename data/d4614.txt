POLICE said the two campus officers shot at Bridgewater College have died. One male suspect is in police custody, officials said and the shelter order was lifted.

An email was sent to students and staff informing them that Campus Police Officer John Painter and Campus Safety Officer JJ Jefferson had died.

“These officers were close friends, known to many of us as the 'dynamic duo.' John was JJ's best man in his wedding this year. They were beloved by students, faculty and staff. I hurt for their families and loved ones, as I know we all do,” Bridgewater College President David Bushman said in the email

Bridgewater College issued a warning on their social media page shortly after 1.30pm on Tuesday following reports of an active shooter.

Bridgewater College warned students on Twitter, saying: "This is not a test."

At the time of the lockdown, one social media user who appeared to be at the scene claimed that there were victims, potentially including a campus police officer.

Students were told not to be alarmed by the police presence on campus and in buildings as the shelter in place order was in action.

Despite the lockdown being lifted, people are being urged to avoid the college and the area around it.

"I have been briefed on the situation at Bridgewater College. The shooter is in custody and state and local police are on the scene," said Governor Glenn Youngkin at the time.

"I will continue to monitor the situation in conjunction with law enforcement."

Bushman called the incident “a sad and dark day for Bridgewater College.”

“I know we all have so many questions and not many answers. One thing I do know, though, is that we rally around one another and support each other as we move forward from this day.

“We are all victims, though some much more so than others, and it will be important that we each seek to find comfort and support in the ways most meaningful for us,” he said.
