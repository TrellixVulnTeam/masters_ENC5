MILLIONS more Brits have been plunged into harsh Tier 4 lockdowns.

Three quarters of England are now living in Tier 4 restrictions, meaning most of the country is now in some form of lockdown.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock put a further 20 million people into the toughest Tier 4 and upgraded millions to Tier 3. No areas will remain Tier 2.

Only 2,000 people living on the Isles of Scilly will remain in Tier 1.

It came after a further 981 people died of coronavirus, with 50,023 new infections confirmed.
