The Republican Party has done everything in their power to punish Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) for serving on the January 6th Select Committee, up to and including stripping her of all of her other committee assignments and even ousting her in her own state from the GOP. Not because there is a significant chance that she’ll be indicted for child sex trafficking; that’s Matt Gaetz and they still back him. Not because he lovingly strokes his gun through meetings and tells supporters to go to war; that’s Madison Cawthorne and they’re fine with him. Not because she said 9/11 was a hoax or because she trolled a colleague on camera, placing a sign saying “there are only 2 genders” outside the office of Rep. Marie Newman, who has a trans child; that’s Marjorie Taylor Greene and they’re okay with her.

Liz Cheney committed the controversial act of daring to criticize Donald Trump and to hold him accountable for inciting an attack against the U.S. government. The GOP will never forgive her.

Cheney is up for reelection in 2022 and Trump, the twice-impeached ex-president who lost the popular vote twice, has loudly criticized her and endorsed her challenger, lawyer Harriet Hageman. Despite this, Cheney raked in her largest donation haul in her career in the most recent reporting quarter at two million dollars.

It’s impossible to predict exactly how long Trump’s hold on the Republican Party will last, and the impact of the upcoming televised hearings by the Jan. 6th committee may also deeply affect the party in the future. For now, however, Cheney does not appear to be losing donor support as she works to hold Trump accountable for the insurrection he incited.

Other challengers for her seat scored far less in donations, but Hageman had a record high of $450,000, a record trumpeted by Fox News and Trump loyalists. Cheney, however, far outpaced her as well as all of her other challengers.
