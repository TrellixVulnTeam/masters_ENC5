Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar has announced that she will be seeking re-election in the 2022 election.

Omar won the 2020 election with 64 percent of the vote.

“When I first ran for this office there was one thing I kept coming back to. Something I said to myself and to the voters over and over: I believe that a better world is possible. I still believe that,” Omar, who represents the 5th Congressional District in Minnesota, said in a statement announcing her re-election, according to a report from WCCO.

Omar was first elected in 2018 with 78 percent of the vote



There is a large amount of evidence that Omar married her own brother to commit immigration fraud.

During a rally in Iowa in October, former President Donald Trump brought up how Omar “doesn’t like Israel too much,” before bringing up the immigration fraud scandal.

“Didn’t she marry her brother? Right?” Trump asked. “She came in, she married her brother — that’s nice.”

Trump continued, “they don’t do anything about it. They don’t do anything about it. With us, they do everything. Right? Oh, they do everything.”
