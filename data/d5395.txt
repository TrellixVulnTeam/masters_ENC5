US Open champion Emma Raducanu is one of six British sports stars nominated for the 2022 Laureus World Sports Awards.

Britain's most successful Paralympian Sarah Storey is also recognised.

The 36-year-old took his tally of Tour de France stage wins to 34 last July to equal the record set by cycling great Eddie Merckx.

He is up for the Laureus World Comeback of the Year Award, along with Daley and Brown.

Raducanu, who was named the 2021 BBC Sports Personality of the Year in December, is among the nominees for the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year Award.

The 19-year-old became the first tennis player to win a Grand Slam title as a qualifier when she beat Leylah Fernandez in New York in September.

Daley ended his long wait for an Olympic gold medal as he took victory alongside Matty Lee in men's synchronised 10m platform event in Tokyo.

At 13 years and 28 days, Brown became Britain's youngest Olympic medal winner of all time when she finished third in the women's park skateboarding final at the Tokyo Games.

Just over a year before the Games, she fractured her skull and broken bones in her arm during a training fall.

Shriever is nominated for the Laureus World Action Sports Award.

The 22-year-old became the first woman to win gold at both the BMX World Championship and the Olympics when she triumphed in the women's BMX racing final.

Storey is in the Laureus Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability category after winning three golds at last year's Paralympic Games.

Her success in Tokyo took her overall gold medal tally to 17 - more than any other British Paralympian.

The winners will be announced in a virtual awards show in April.
