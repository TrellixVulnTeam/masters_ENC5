'We can't tell Luke to put another jumper on'

'I put £10 of fuel in not £20'

"It wasn't long ago that you would fill your car up. That doesn't happen anymore. So it's 'ok, put £10 of fuel in not £20' and it's £10 as and when really. It's ridiculous things like that you shouldn't have to think about."

'It's not just us, it's everybody'

'I use my microwave more than my oven'

'We don't want to get ourselves into debt'

"I suppose everybody has a feeling of 'I just have to get by', that's the way people think with pride and everything, so by talking about it and saying everyone's in the same boat it's not such a taboo subject."

"We're providing extensive support to those on the lowest incomes, including putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on Universal Credit, increasing the minimum wage and helping with the cost of fuel bills," said a UK government spokesperson.
