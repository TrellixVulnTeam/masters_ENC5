Uruguayan midfielder Bentancur costs an initial £15.8million in a permanent deal that could rise to over £20m, on a four-and-a-half-year contract until 2026.

Kulusevski, who also arrives from Juventus, joins on loan for the next 18 months for a fee of £8.4m.

The Swedish winger has been confirmed for the No21 shirt at Tottenham Stadium, a number most recently donned by fellow South Americans Juan Foyth and Federico Fazio.

Bentancur, meanwhile, will don the No30 shirt which Gedson Fernandes wore last season.

It means the shirt numbers vacated by Dele Alli (No20), Tanguy Ndombele (No28), Giovani Lo Celso (No18) and Bryan Gil (No11) all remain unfilled despite their January departures.

Kulusevski revealed his excitement at working under Antonio Conte after sealing his switch, having faced the former Inter Milan coach in Serie A.

“I’m looking forward to working with the coach, I know him from Inter,” Kulusevski said. “He’s a very good coach, he’s a winner and that’s what I want to be. I’m very happy that he’s here, and it’s part of why I came here.

“I’m going to listen to him, he knows what he’s talking about and I know that his teams are always working really hard. That’s what I love.

“I want to learn as much as possible with him and collaborate with the players here.”
