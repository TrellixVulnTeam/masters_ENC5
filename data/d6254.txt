Bongino Report no longer has a Google AdSense account and reports are conflicted as to why.

Bongino Report said it “permanently banned” Google Ads from its website.

“Breaking: We have permanently banned @GoogleAds from our website, http://BonginoReport.com,” the site tweeted from its Twitter account. “They will not be allowed to return. @Google is an existential threat to freedom and liberty.”

In contrast, however, Google claimed it removed the ads from the account, not Bongino Report. Google said the site “persistently” breached its policies.

“We have strict publisher policies in place that explicitly prohibit misleading and harmful content around the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrably false claims about our elections,” Google said. “When publishers persistently breach our policies we stop serving Google ads on their sites. Publishers can always appeal a decision once they have addressed any violating content.”

Bongino was also suspended from YouTube after the platform claimed he violated its policies against so-called “misinformation” about the pandemic.

YouTube reportedly told Forbes that Bongino "repeatedly violat[ed] our Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines on harmful and dangerous acts."

Rumble later tweeted a statement of support for the former Secret Service agent:

“Dan Bongino, one of the most vocal supporters of free speech and the 1st amendment was just suspended on YouTube where their CEO says free speech is a 'core value'. Freedom of expression is a human right, full stop. @dbongino & all creators, we have your back.#StandWithDan.”
