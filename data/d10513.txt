Truckers for "Freedom Convoy" were greeted by farmers who used their tractors to penetrate the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) roadblocks at the Canada-US border in Coutts, Alberta, as talks broke down.

True North and Rebel News reported farmers joined to strengthen the convoy as negotiations in Coutts between the truckers and Mounties collapsed on Tuesday afternoon.

RCMP tried to establish a barricade, but that failed as farmers broke through and led a convoy of truckers closer to the border with Montana.

Farmers and truckers stepped out of the respective tractors and trucks and sang the national anthem of Canada, "O Canada," in unison. Apparently, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (who, by the way, is still in hiding and is triple-jabbed after testing positive for COVID-19), has called these folks "fringe" and "racists."

Maybe Trudeau is the "racist" one?

Here's a drone video of the convoy on the border from last night.

Canada's freedom rally is being watched worldwide as ordinary citizens band together and protest medical tyranny by the government.

Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, recently tweeted Canadian truckers "rule." Joe Rogan has said the "country is in revolt."

Canada is in revolt, and the president is in hiding; people are standing up for their medical freedom -- this is something governments have yet to deal with in the last two years of the pandemic. The world is watching Canada, and these demonstrations are spreading worldwide.
