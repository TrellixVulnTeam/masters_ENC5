ROCK n roll fans can party with Buddy Holly and the Cricketers in Southampton next week.

The 30th anniversary tour stops at MAST Mayflower Studios on Friday February 11.

It features authentic arrangements, skilled musicianship and always has audiences dancing in the aisles!

Songs include all-time favourites That’ll Be The Day, Peggy Sue, Heartbeat, It Doesn’t Matter Anymore, Raining In My Heart, Oh Boy! and more.

Producer Simon Fielder, a former actor in the original touring and West End show, said: “It’s been an incredibly difficult couple of years for us all. So many plans put on hold or dashed completely. We had hoped to tour more extensively last year, but audience and venue uncertainty made this impossible. So, we are absolutely delighted to finally get back on the road and on stage and allow people to put life’s problems out of their heads for a couple of hours and enjoy a fabulous party with Buddy and the boys. Pandemics and other adverse events may hold us back a while, but Rock ’n’ Roll will never die!"

Buddy’s music has touched the heart of millions around the world and influenced many famous artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Brian May and others.

This show has been delighting audiences for nearly three decades and has been performed worldwide.

It stars some of the finest actor-musicians in the UK including Jason Shaw as Buddy and has appeared on BBC TV.
