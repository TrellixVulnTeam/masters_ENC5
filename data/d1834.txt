A mother of two who was killed on a busy street by her ex-husband died from stab wounds after a 'have-a-go hero' allegedly used his car to try and break up the attack.

Yasmin “Wafah” Chkaifi, 43, was murdered just minutes away from her home outside the entrance to a park in Maida Vale, west London.

A 26-year-old motorist is alleged to have run over and killed the knifeman, Leon McCaskie, during the assault, before being arrested on suspicion of murder. He has since been released on bail.

An inquest at Westminster Coroner’s Court heard an arrest warrant for Mr McCaskie had been issued three weeks prior to the incident.

Speaking after the incident, family members of Ms Chkaifi praised the driver for his "heroic" actions.
