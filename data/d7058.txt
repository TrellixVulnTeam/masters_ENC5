A Reddit user named u/TerpinOne has shared a photo of the diagram their fiancé made to explain the settings on the shower in their AirBnB.

In case that’s not clear, it says this –

We love how it goes from ‘Erected [sic] Nipple Cold’ to ‘Brimstone Heat’ with no nuance whatsoever. Highly relatable.

Other Redditors loved the diagram, too.

OMG!!! I love this!!!! My house is old and I have this very same problem without the cool and handy guide!!

Someone had their own version of ‘hot’ to share.

They might want to consider tiling.

‘My shower control’ is the most relatable thing we’ve seen this week
