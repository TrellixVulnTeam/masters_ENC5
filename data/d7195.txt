A trusty lipstick can be a best friend in our beauty bags and it's an easy way to make an effort with your makeup. If you feel like adding a positive pop of colour, aesthetically, there's no faster pick-me-up.

Going for a bold lip often releases you from having to bother with the rest of the creams and powders that play a part in your makeup routine - so sweep some colour across for an instant revamp. Alternatively, keep things simple and chic with a dependable nude tone.

The introduction of face masks in 2020 saw many of us put the lipstick to the side of our dressing table, leaving it to be discarded at the bottom of our makeup bags - but brands developing new formulas to stay resilient means the lipstick is making a strong comeback.

In terms of shades, darker tones such as browns, plums and browns can age your face. Try reds with a hint of orange for that sprightly spring look - corals, peaches and rose pinks always work well - or opt for a pink-toned nude lipstick if you're going for a more minimalistic approach.

Wearing the right lipstick can make you feel like you can rule the world so there's no shame in taking your time finding your go-to shade.

We've tried and verified some of the best in the business - in case you don't have the time to - that will suitably see you through the year.
