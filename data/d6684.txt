Sir Lindsay Hoyle has made a statement about accusations of lying ahead of PMQs.

He said the chair will not tolerate accusations of lying and that is the longstanding practice in the house.

He said there are plenty of ways of making feelings felt within the rules.

He said: "I recognise there are frustrations around the House - there are means by which accusations of lying may be brought before the house including a substantive motion."

"Of course long-standing practices may change if the House decided it wanted a different approach, perhaps informed by the procedure committee but it is not for me to change the practice unilaterally‚Äù.
