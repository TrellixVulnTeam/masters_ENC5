Julia Bradbury returned to This Morning for the first time since undergoing a mastectomy late last year, to help ITV give away 60,000 trees to viewers.

The Countryfile presenter was diagnosed with breast cancer in-situ in September and underwent a mastectomy the following month.

But she was back on Tuesday morning, to get some ‘green therapy’ in as she presented from the This Morning forest.

Updating the hosts, she said: ‘First of all, I want to say thanks to the whole this morning team, you’ve been checking in with me regularly to see when I’d be back.

‘It’s so lovely to be back, you’ve been sending me little messages, “are you ready?” And today, I was ready.

‘It’s a beautiful morning in the forest and I wanted to help give away these trees, and the doctor said yes, it was alright.

‘I’m recovering, I had a mastectomy a couple of months ago, I’ve been doing physio and lots of treatment,’ she told viewers.

Julia went on to reassure fans her healing is going ‘very well’ adding: ‘I’ve taken this opportunity to suck in the green therapy and I’m going to go for a little walk around the forest when we’ve finished.

Rochelle concluded the introduction by telling her how ‘pleased’ she was to see Julia doing so well.

Julia confirmed her return to This Morning on Monday night, telling fans on social media: ‘Baby steps! I’m back in my happy place among the trees for one morning only. I’ll be live @thismorning @itv in the forest from 10am.

‘My doc has cleared me for a morning. It involves trees & possibly you. Tune in to see why #ThisMorning #trees #forest #greetherapy #nature #woodlands

It comes after Julia shared some important advice to those who are facing a mastectomy themselves, reassuring them they would ‘get through’ it.

She put out a video on her Instagram not long after her operation, where she explained how pleased she was just to be able to crawl her hand up the wall.

‘To all the ladies on the cusp of a mastectomy.. this was me a few weeks ago. It gets easier & I don’t even think about the wall crawl anymore.

‘I know what you’re going through is unbelievable & unthinkable… But you can get through. It’s unfair that this is part of the ‘treatment’ but as I said to myself just before my op ‘I don’t want the alternative.’ Sending love & healing vibes your way.’

This Morning airs weekdays from 10am on ITV.
