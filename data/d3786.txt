Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke out against anti-vaccine mandate protesters who vandalized property in Ottawa and harassed the staff and clients at a homeless shelter.A convoy of truckers protesting against measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, including vaccine mandates and wearing masks, began arriving in Ottawa on Friday.Additionally, "the incessant honking and noise from trucks caused significant anxiety and distress to our staff and shelter residents," Shepherds of Good Hope said.Fox was an athlete and cancer research activist who died in 1981 and is considered one of Canada's national heroes. A sign reading "Mandate Freedom" was placed in the arms of his statue, as well as an upside down Canadian flag. This is "completely unacceptable," Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding, "This kind of stunt by protesters does not help their cause."It's estimated that about 90 percent of Canadian truck drivers have been vaccinated, Reuters reports, and the Canadian Trucking Alliance said "it appears that a great number" of the protesters in Ottawa "have no connection to the trucking industry and have a separate agenda beyond a disagreement over cross-border vaccine requirements."
