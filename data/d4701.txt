A comfortable retirement is the end goal for most workers building up their pension. However, it can be hard to know how much you will need to see you through your later years.

According to consumer group Which?, the price tag of a happy retirement is £305,000. Someone who wants a “comfortable” retirement would need at least £19,000 per year or £26,000 for a couple.

Savers need their pensions to provide £12,548 per year. In addition to the average state pension payout of £8,060, it would give them £19,000 after tax. This annual income would be enough to cover the essentials and regular short-haul holidays, leisure, tobacco, alcohol and giving to charity, according to Which?.

This would cost £305,710 if bought using an annuity at age 65. However, savers who kept their pension pot invested in the stock market and regularly took income, known as drawdown, would only need £192,290, some £113,000 less.
