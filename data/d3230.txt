WYRE Forest MP Mark Garnier says he agrees with the Prime Minister that No10 "needs to change" following the publication of the Sue Gray report.

Boris Johnson apologised to MPs on Monday after senior official Sue Gray found “failures of leadership and judgment” as gatherings were held while England was under coronavirus restrictions in 2020 and 2021.

As part of his weekly Shuttle column, Mr Garnier said: "The Gray Report was, sort of, published on Monday. Less of a report, more of an update, it gave just over one side of A4 to its findings and conclusions on Downing Street’s breaches of Covid lockdown rules.

"In so far as it said anything, it was not good reading. There is unquestionably a poor culture at No10 that needs to change. But more importantly, the Metropolitan Police are investigating criminal activities, although these result in fixed penalty notices without criminal records.

"There is a lot of anger. I have received about 350 emails. To put that into context, that is about a third of the full blown anger at Dominic Cummings’ antics in 2020 and his Barnard Castle field trip. But equally, I am hearing a lot of people who feel this is all overblown, and that the PM has done well (as he clearly has) with leading the globe in vaccinations, the furlough measures, economic recovery, jobs and, of course, getting Brexit done.

"Despite these clear successes, that is no excuse for drunken parties in the office and the Prime Minister believes that No10 needs to change. I agree and I await his detailed proposals. I also await the full report from Sue Gray, that will be published, without redactions, when the police produce their report.

"So, far from being able to pass judgement on what has been going on, we are no further than we were before the interim update was published."
