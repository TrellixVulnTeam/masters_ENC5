Spotify has announced will add ‘content advisories’, i.e. trigger warnings, to podcast episodes that discuss COVID-19, directing people to the platform’s ‘COVID-19 Guide‘, which includes podcasts by BBC News, the Economist, the New Scientist, the Guardian and Nature. In addition, it has published its ‘Platform Rules‘, which include the following description of ‘Dangerous Content’ that will be banned from the music streaming platform:

Content that promotes dangerous false or dangerous deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or poses a direct threat to public health includes, but may not be limited to:

– asserting that AIDS, COVID-19, cancer or other serious life threatening diseases are a hoax or not real

 – encouraging the consumption of bleach products to cure various illnesses and diseases

 – promoting or suggesting that vaccines approved by local health authorities are designed to cause death

 – encouraging people to purposely get infected with COVID-19 in order to build immunity to it (e.g. promoting or hosting “coronavirus parties”)

These announcements are clearly intended as a sop to the musical artists and others who are unhappy about Spotify’s decision not to remove Joe Rogan’s podcast in response to Neil Young’s threat to withdraw his music unless it did. But will they be sufficient to quell the rebellion? According to the Verge, which broke the story, an internal memo revealed that Joe Rogan’s podcast doesn’t “meet the threshold for removal” under these new rules.
