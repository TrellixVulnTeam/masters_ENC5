The case of a 3-year-old boy from Cyprus who was initially denied treatment in foreign hospitals because his parents were unvaccinated has raised concerns about whether doctors should be allowed to turn away patients.After three countries refused to treat the boy, he is now in Greece awaiting surgery.As Cypriot hospitals were unable to perform the necessary procedure, the health ministry arranged for the boy to be taken by air ambulance to Germany last Thursday.. However, the official added that each hospital has its own restrictions and makes its own arrangements with patients."Health policies — including vaccination policies — and their concrete implementation are the responsibility of the member states, not the Commission," said a spokesperson for the European Commission's health department.However,, according to the Cypriot health ministry's director general, Christina Yiannaki.The parents were both vaccinated on Thursday, but they would still have to wait six weeks before being accepted by the foreign hospitals and the child has to be operated upon immediately."I know that unvaccinated patients are admitted to hospitals in Germany," said the boy's father , Alexey Matveev, a Russian national living in Cyprus.Yiannaki said the parents had been informed ahead of time of the need for vaccination.Cypriot officials said they had suggested the parents get the single dose J&J vaccine, to speed up the process, but they refused. Matveev rejected that claim, and said they had received the Pfizer vaccine on the advice of the German medical center.The child had another operation in the summer, but only a PCR test was then required for the parents to accompany him, according to Avraam Elia, director of the pediatrics clinic in Makarios hospital, where the child was hospitalized. Cypriot authorities have said they warned the parents that the rules could change and that vaccination might be required.Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston took DJ Ferguson off their transplant list, saying in a statement to the BBC that because of a shortage of available organs, they have to do everything they can "to ensure that a patient who receives a transplanted organ has the greatest chance of survival."
