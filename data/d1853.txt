A 'megaflash' bolt of lightning that spanned nearly 500 miles across three US states has set the record for the most far-reaching ever.

The lightning occurred in the southern US in April 2020, extending 477.2 miles through Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi - around the distance between London and Hamburg.

It beat the old 2018 record set in Brazil by almost 40 miles.

Ordinarily, lightning does not last for longer than a second or stretch further than 10 miles, Randall Cerveny at Arizona State University, told the New Scientist. This lightning - known as a 'megaflash' because of its size - moved from cloud to cloud rather than to the ground.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) also identified another lightning bolt over Uruguay and northern Argentina in 2020 that lasted 17.3 seconds - a new record.

“We now have clear proof that single lightning events can last seventeen seconds,” said Mr Cerveny.

“This is important to scientists because it improves our understanding of the dynamics of lightning – how, where and, importantly, why lightning occurs the way it does.”
