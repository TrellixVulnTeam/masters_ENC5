Odell Beckham will make a massive amount of cash if the Rams win the Super Bowl.

The Rams will play the Bengals February 13 in Super Bowl LVI for a chance to lift the Lombardi Trophy, and if they get the job done, the star receiver will make a fat stack! (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

According to Field Yates, OBJ will earn a bonus of $1 million if the Rams win. BroBible reported that the former Browns receiver will earn $500,000 win or lose as soon as he plays a single snap against the Bengals.

Obviously, I’m cheering for the Rams because of Matthew Stafford, but it’s also been great watching OBJ resurrect his career in Los Angeles.

As I said Monday, everyone wanted to write him off when the Browns cut him loose. People acted like he could never play at a high level again.

Now, he’s one win away from winning the Lombardi Trophy and a $1 million bonus. After all the stuff he came back from, how could you not pull for OBJ and the Rams?

The Bengals are fun, but the Rams are way more interesting with Stafford and Odell coming from bad franchises and balling out in Los Angeles.

Make sure to catch the game February 13. I can’t wait!
