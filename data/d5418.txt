The Financial Times says the money "squandered" on PPE by the government is actually closer to £10bn, with an additional £1.2bn lost on orders which could not be cancelled. The paper says this is on top of the £4bn spent on faulty or surplus kit and a £4.7bn loss after the market price for PPE dropped well below what the government paid.
