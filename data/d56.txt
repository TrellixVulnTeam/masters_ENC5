THE Met Office issued fresh danger to life warning as Storm Corrie brought 92mph winds to the UK - just hours after Malik wreaked deadly havoc.

Severe gusts have left 30,000 people without power in Scotland on top of the 7,000 who were already cut off as a result of Storm Malik.

Northern Powergrid says there are an additional 4,000 people in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear and County Durham without power today.

The chaos comes just hours after Storm Malik killed two people.

Yesterday, a nine-year-old boy became Storm Malik's second victim after he was crushed to death by a tree - after a woman, 60, was killed in Scotland.

The tree toppled down on the youngster - who was with an elderly relative who suffered a head injury - shortly after 1.10pm in Tean, Staffs, on Saturday afternoon.
