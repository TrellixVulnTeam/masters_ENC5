Valentine’s Day is the moment when even the most infrequent of diners crosses the threshold of a restaurant. February the 14th falls on a Monday this year, when many restaurants are closed because of staff shortages, so the need to reserve a table that won’t make you look like the world’s worst partner is more acute than ever.

But while the proposal-worthy likes of The Ritz and Clos Maggiore may have been fully booked for months, there are still enough romantic restaurants in the capital where making a reservation won’t spell the end of your relationship. Each of the restaurants below still had space for two for dinner on Valentine’s Day at the time of publication but, if all else fails, remember that cancellations are easier to come by than you think and it’s always worth calling on the day. Just remember that this is the one night of the year when boasting about your ability to bag a last-minute table is unlikely to win you a goodnight kiss.

Even the most tongue-tied of dates will find something to talk about at this nostalgia-hued dining room within Mayfair’s Beaumont hotel, where a McCarthy salad mixed on a trolley, bananas Foster flambéed in rum and bespoke sundaes assembled with a tick-box of toppings make the tableside theatre the best show in the West End.
