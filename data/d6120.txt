The Colin the Caterpillar cake dispute between Marks & Spencer and Aldi is finally over.

Both supermarkets confirmed an agreement had been struck but said they could not release details of the ‘confidential’ deal.

The feud started in April last year when M&S took legal action against Aldi claiming Cuthbert the Caterpillar was ‘too similar to Colin’.

M&S claimed Aldi was riding ‘on the coat-tails’ of its reputation and wanted Cuthbert taken off the shelves for good.

Cuthbert disappeared from shops but made a comeback in May after Aldi made changes to his chocolate face.

The row played out over social media, with Aldi dishing out sassy comebacks to M&S.

Cuthbert even made a cameo appearance in Aldi’s Christmas ad, where he was spotted being arrested.

Deputy Master Timothy John Bowles today signed off an agreement in a consent order at the High Court.

An M&S spokesman said: ‘The objective of the claim was to protect the IP (intellectual property) in our Colin the Caterpillar cake and we are very pleased with the outcome.’

Meanwhile, Aldi said Cuthbert was now ‘free’ following the dispute.

An Aldi spokesperson said: ‘Cuthbert is free and looking forward to seeing all his fans again very soon.’

M&S and Aldi are also involved in a separate copyright dispute over allegations the German rival copied an M&S ‘light-up’ gin liqueur product.

The M&S spokesman added: ‘Like many other UK businesses, large and small, we know the true value and cost of innovation and the enormous time, passion, creativity, energy and attention to detail, that goes into designing, developing and bringing a product to market and building its brand over many years.

‘So it is understandable that we want to defend our intellectual property and protect our suppliers – many of them small businesses that have worked with us for decades.’
