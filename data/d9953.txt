DELE ALLI believes he has found “the perfect match” by moving to Everton and working with Frank Lampard.

And after being dumped by Tottenham, the 25-year-old midfielder says he finally feels wanted again.

Dele joined the Toffees on deadline day in a deal that could hit £40million — just hours after Lampard was unveiled as their new manager.

He said: “Frank is an amazing manager and an amazing person.

“He knows me very well as a player, I know him and his tactics and how he likes his teams to work.

“I can learn so much from him.

“He scored a lot of goals from midfield, I will speak to him about that and the way he fought on the pitch and what he did to make the most of his talent.

“It is a perfect match and I can’t wait to get going.”

FREE BETS: GET OVER £2,000 IN NEW CUSTOMER DEALS

Dele, who arrived at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground in a £300,000 Rolls-Royce, will cost Farhad Moshiri’s side £10m after 20 games, with add-ons potentially taking the cost to four times that amount.

The former England star is cup tied for Saturday’s FA Cup fourth-round visit of Brentford.

But he added: “The owner and chairman were the first people I spoke to.

“I felt very comfortable and confident and wanted.

“As a player, the main thing is to feel wanted.

“Especially as an attacking and creative player, you want to know you can express yourself and bring excitement to the game, with and without the ball.

“That’s what I want to do and the kind of player I am.”
