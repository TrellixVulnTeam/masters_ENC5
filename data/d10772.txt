Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The Biden administration said it will not use statements obtained through torture during any stage of the legal proceedings concerning a Guantanamo Bay detainee accused of being the mastermind behind a fatal bombing of a U.S. Navy destroyer more than 20 years ago.

The brief filed Monday night in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is a reversal from the government's previous stance that sought to use statements obtained from Abd al-Rahim Hussein al-Nashiri by the CIA through so-called enhanced interrogation techniques during pre-trial proceedings.
