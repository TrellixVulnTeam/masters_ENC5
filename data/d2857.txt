In a question and answer session on his paid-for blog on Tuesday, Mr Cummings was asked if there were photos that would “incriminate” the Prime Minister.

He said: “Yes there are photos of the PM at parties under investigation. Ive spoken to people who say theyve seen photos of parties in the flat.”

Meanwhile another Tory MP has called on Mr Johnson to resign over the partygate scandal and submitted a letter of no confidence in his leadership.

Peter Aldous, the MP for Waveney, said he had “never taken such action before” but had been put in an “invidious position” by repeated allegations of lawbreaking by the prime minister and Downing Street staff during lockdown.

Mr Aldous said he had given the letter to chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady. A vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson’s premiership will be called if 54 letters are submitted.

The news follows the publication of a summary of Sue Gray’s report into gatherings held during lockdown in No10, with the senior civil servant accusing Downing Street officials of a “failure of leadership”.

Downing Street was forced into a U-turn on Monday after suggesting the report may not be published in full - sparking anger among Tory backbenchers.
