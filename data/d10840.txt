Sandra Di Carlo Valdez looked at her Christmas tree in January and felt a wave of sadness. One week into 2022 and nearly two years into a pandemic, the tree was a source of joy; she wasn’t ready to take it down.

So Ms. Valdez, 46, a nail technician and blogger in Miami with nearly 30,000 followers on Instagram, decided to try something she’d seen on social media: She would keep the tree up but redecorate it, swapping the ornaments for organza and the holly for hearts.

Her Christmas tree, now covered in pink and red baubles, has become a Valentine’s tree.

Taylor Swift may leave her Christmas lights up until January, but online, images of evergreens (real and fake) decked in candy hearts and pastel tinsel have been popping up well into February, mostly on certain crafty corners of Instagram, TikTok and Pinterest.

Ms. Valdez redecorates her tree using supplies from Dollar Tree: heart clips, which she affixed to the branches; wooden hearts, which she painted; and provisions like pinheads and red and pink fabric that she turned into homemade gnome ornaments.
