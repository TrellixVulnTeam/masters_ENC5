With news that Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) might finally be calling time on his marriage to Linda (Kellie Bright) on EastEnders, Janine (Charlie Brooks) must feel that now is the time to be lining herself up as the next Mrs Carter.

Mick makes one last effort to reconcile with Linda, taking Ollie to meet his mum. Janine, for some reason we couldn’t even begin to guess at, is against this scheme and tries to persuade Mick not to go.

She’s secretly pleased to learn later that Linda didn’t show up and a reluctant Mick is beginning to accept that he and Linda are over.

But before Janine can swoop in and bag her man, he decides to join Rocky (Brian Conley), Harvey (Ross Boatman) and Mitch (Roger Griffiths) on a trip to Ruby’s – where they hope to attract the attention of some female company.

Once again, Janine tries to put Mick off the plan, but he’s determined. After a quick trip to the gym to hone his manly physique, Mick heads off to Ruby’s. Janine tries to get out of work so she can go, too, but Nancy (Maddy Hill)’s having none of it.

With a frustrated Janine out of the picture, Mick’s free to do what he likes. And it’s not long before he attracts some attention when he gets on well with a woman called Angela.
