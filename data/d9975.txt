Bed nets save lives in the long run, researchers have found, after a study showed that those who slept under them as children were more likely to survive into adulthood than those who did not.

Insecticide treated bed nets are a crucial tool in malaria prevention and millions have been handed out in sub Saharan Africa over the past 20 years. However, some people have hypothesised that children who are protected from malaria will not build immunity to the disease, making them more vulnerable as adults.

Malaria exacts a heavy toll – particularly in sub Saharan Africa, where the majority of death and disease occurs. According to the latest figures in the World Malaria Report, there were an estimated 241 million malaria cases and 627,000 deaths from the mosquito-borne disease in 2020.

The latest study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, followed more than 6,700 children from 1998, tracking them again in 2019 to find out what happened to them.

The research – the first of its kind to track what happens to children who sleep under bed nets over such a long period – provides new insights into the long-term effectiveness of malaria control measures, the study authors said.

Between 1998 and 2003, the study enrolled 6,706 children born in two districts of rural Tanzania where malaria is endemic. Up to 2003, a survey team visited the children’s households every four months to collect information about how often the nets were used.

Participants were questioned about their use of bed nets and were asked if they always, sometimes or never slept under them. Of those involved, 1,693 said they always used bed nets, 3,492 said they sometimes did and 1,515 said they never used them.
