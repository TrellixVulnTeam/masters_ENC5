Lacazette joined the Gunners from Lyon in 2017, but his time in north London looks to be coming to an end with no sign of a new deal being signed.

He has an important role to play for Arsenal though, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joining Barcelona on a free transfer, as the club’s main striker in the push for a top four place.

Come the end of the season, Lyon will be pushing to bring Lacazette back to France.

“We’ll do our best to sign Alexandre Lacazette in June,” Aulas said.

Lyon director Vincent Ponsot echoed the words of Aulas, revealing that the club have regularly kept in touch with Lacazette during his time in England. He did warn though that it would not be an easy deal to do.

“We’ve seen the maturity that he’s acquired, we’ve always remained in contact with him,” Ponsot said.

“But bringing in big players is always complicated.”
