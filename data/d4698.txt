More Covid cases have been reported globally in the last 10 weeks than in the whole of 2020 because of the highly transmissible omicron variant, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.



Some 90 million cases of the disease have been reported to WHO since the end of November compared to 79.2 million for the whole of 2020, the organisation’s director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference. He said the number of deaths was also beginning to increase. 



The WHO chief said he was concerned about a narrative taking hold in some countries that "because of vaccines, and because of omicron’s high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible, and no longer necessary".



"Nothing could be further from the truth," Dr Tedros told the briefing. "More transmission means more deaths. We are not calling for any country to return to so-called lockdown. But we are calling on all countries to protect their people using every tool in the toolkit, not vaccines alone."



Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid, said many countries had still not reached the peak in omicron cases and countries should lift measures slowly.



"Many countries have low levels of vaccination coverage with very vulnerable individuals within their populations," said Dr Van Kerkhove.



"And so now is not the time to lift everything all at once. We have always urged, always (be) very cautious, in applying interventions as well as lifting those interventions in a steady and in a slow way, piece by piece. Because this virus is quite dynamic," she added.



She added: "It’s premature for any country to surrender or to declare victory.

Denmark became the latest country to ease all Covid restrictions on Tuesday as it no longer considers the Covid outbreak "a socially-critical disease". Vaccination rates are also high, with 81 per cent of the population double vaccinated and 61 per cent having received a booster.
