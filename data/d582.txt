Despite agreeing a fee in the region of £8m, Jurgen Klopp will now have to wait until the summer at least in order to land the 19-year-old.

Carvalho will be out of contract at the end of the season but would have remained at Craven Cottage anyway even if a move had been pushed through. As part of the arrangement, Fulham would kept him on loan for the remainder of their promotion push.

Still, the relevant paperwork was not filed in time and Carvalho will stay at this boyhood club under Marco Silva’s stewardship. In what has been a breakthrough campaign, the teenager has scored seven goals in 18 Championship outings.

Elsewhere at Liverpool, Nathaniel Phillips - once a target for West Ham - moved to Championship side Bournemouth on loan for the rest of the season.
