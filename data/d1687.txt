A blustery winter storm is expected to sweep through nearly 2,000 miles of the central United States starting on Tuesday evening, bringing a mix of freezing temperatures, heavy snow and potentially hazardous traveling conditions from parts of New Mexico and Texas up through Illinois and Michigan, weather officials said.

At various times through this week, a winter storm watch is forecast to be in effect from central New Mexico up through northern Vermont. A small portion of Colorado and Kansas, along with a large swath of the Midwest, is also expected to be under a winter storm warning.

Parts of New Mexico are expected to get as much as 14 inches of snow — most on Wednesday night — and some lower-lying areas will remain below freezing from Tuesday night through Friday or Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. By Friday morning, the temperatures in parts of eastern New Mexico could feel like 20 to 25 degrees below zero, with the wind chill factor, said Brian Guyer, a meteorologist with the Weather Service.

“It’s uncommon for us to have the combination of snow with the temperatures that we’re expected to see” in New Mexico, Mr. Guyer said.
