The IOPC explained: “We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’.”

The watchdog’s regional director, Sal Naseem, said: “The behaviour we uncovered is disgraceful and fell well below the standards expected of the officers involved.

“While these officers predominantly worked in teams in Westminster, which have since been disbanded, we know from other recent cases that these issues are not isolated or historic.

“Colleagues were afraid to speak out about these behaviours for fear of being ostracised, demeaned or told to get another job.”

In an official statement, the force apologised and said the conduct of a team of officers at Charing Cross police station did not represent its “values”.

“We are deeply sorry to Londoners and everyone they have failed with their appalling conduct and acknowledge how this will damage the trust and confidence of many in the Met,” it said.

“Since this reprehensible behaviour was uncovered in 2017 we have taken a series of measures to hold those responsible to account and stamp out unacceptable behaviour.”
