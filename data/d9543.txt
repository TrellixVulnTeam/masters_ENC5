What a dope.

 George Bush spits on Trump voters and donates to Liz Cheney and Lisa Murkowski.

 He might as well join the Marxist left at this point.

Former President George W. Bush is jumping into 2022’s heated Republican primary races, documents revealed on Monday, opening his pocketbook to two GOP lawmakers caught in his Republican successor Donald Trump’s crosshairs.

Campaign finance disclosures show Bush donated to the re-election campaigns of Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of his former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski.

Both establishment Republican legislators are facing primary challenges from candidates endorsed by Trump.
