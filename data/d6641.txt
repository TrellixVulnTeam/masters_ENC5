Jennifer Lopez hands down won the day Tuesday after she posted a series of pictures on Instagram of her in a strappy jacket and skirt combination from her latest photoshoot.

The 52-year-old superstar singer looked truly stunning as she posed wearing a long-sleeve black cropped jacket with an extremely low-cut black skirt in several photos. Her caption tagged several things including The New York Times who she did the shoot with and her upcoming rom-com “Marry Me” movie.

She completed the look with her hair pulled up in a loose bun, a black bra top and jewelry.

In several other photos from the same post, the “Hustlers” star posed wearing a hot pink bandeau top and skirt combination. (SLIDESHOW: 142 Times Josephine Skriver Stunned Fans On Instagram)
