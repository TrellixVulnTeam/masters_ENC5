Stroud MP Siobhan Baillie has hit out at anti-vaxxers during a statement in the House of Commons after it was announced Gloucestershire would be moving into Tier 4.

This afternoon Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed that the entirety of Gloucestershire – including Stroud – would be subject to the very highest restrictions from tomorrow (Thursday, December 31).

Speaking in the House of Commons after the announcement Ms Baillie said that many Gloucestershire businesses “are gutted to be placed in Tier 4” and that it makes the “rollout of the vaccine even more important”.

It comes after the UK’s Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine was given approval this morning.

But Ms Baille also raised concerns about the “worrying increase” of Covid information from unofficial sources and the rise in the anti-vax movement.

She said: “There is a worrying increase of anti-vax information in Stroud which is causing a lot of distress and upset for local people.
