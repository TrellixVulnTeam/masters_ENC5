I have known for a few years that McDonald’s has been in trouble and they have been desperate to get the magic back to that end they have decided to add four new menu items. However, it’s not really a matter of adding new items as much as it is about combining old menu items. This leads me to believe there is a difference between desperate and insane.

I see this as a great moneymaking proposition. I intend to invest all of my money in cardiology. Or maybe start selling insurance to those who order these sandwiches. I could also open a Mercedes dealership to accommodate the cardiologists with extra money to spend. I got it. I’ll buy up property next to McDonald’s franchises and rent out the buildings to cardiologists looking for a convenient location that could attract a lot of customers.
• Crunchy Double – six chicken nuggets in the middle of a double cheeseburger.
• Land, Air and Sea – with one bun, a combination of a chicken sandwich, a Big Mac and a Filet-O-Fish.
• Surf and Turf – a combination of a double cheeseburger and a Filet-O-Fish that is only available through delivery or on the company’s app.

The new items will be offered for just a little while in what the company refers to as thinning out the herd. But, if any or all of the new menu items do especially well, you could see them added permanently.

McDonald’s joins other chains — such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks and The Cheesecake Factory — in placing items patrons have created themselves on their menus for a limited time, according to CNN.

McDonald’s tried a similar idea in November with the “Sweet Chicken Sammie,” another hack made by ordering a McChicken Biscuit and syrup with an Egg McMuffin. (RELATED: McDonald’s Will Require Workers And Customers To Wear Masks, Vaccinated Or Not)

“This campaign shows that it has never been ‘our menu’ — the menu belongs to our fans,” said Jennifer Healan, vice president for marketing and content at McDonald’s. “We’re excited to celebrate them in a bigger way than ever before by putting their delicious hacks — as seen on social media — on our menus.”
