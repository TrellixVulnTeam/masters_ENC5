Vitti’s death was announced by writer, director and politician Walter Veltroni on behalf of Vitti’s partner, Roberto Russo, with whom she had been with since 1973.

The film star, who shot to fame in the 1960s, had been battling Alzheimers disease for two decades.

Vitti was best known for her roles in films by director Michelangelo Antonioni, including L’Avventura (1960), Red Desert (1964), L’Eclisse (1962) and La Notte (1961),
