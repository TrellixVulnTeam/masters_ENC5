CHILDREN’S telly favourites Dick and Dom are struggling to join TikTok as their name is deemed too rude.

The comedy duo tried to set up an account but administrators told them the name Dick breached the video-sharing app’s guidelines.

Dick and Dom — otherwise known as Richard McCourt, 45, and 44-year-old Dominic Wood — have a large social media following with 67,000 fans on Twitter, 38,000 on Instagram and 36,000 on Facebook.

The pair are best known for the game Bogies on TV show Dick and Dom In Da Bungalow, where they would go to quiet public places and shout “bogies” at gradually increasing volumes.

They said: “How the hell are we supposed to join TikTok? We can’t sign up and no one can search for us.”

Searching for the duo’s names returns a page that says: “This phrase may be associated with behaviour or content that violates our guidelines.

Last January, they lost all their Twitter followers.

They had changed their date of birth on their homepage to 1996 to mark 25 years of working together.

But because the account was set up in 2009, Twitter bosses thought that put them under the age of 13 when it was created and booted them off.
