THIS week I bring you two brilliant freezable soup recipes that are guaranteed to warm you up on a cold February day.

Nutritious and delicious soups are something I always have a batch of. I love freezing them in individual containers for quick work lunches.

Make sure you label your batched meals before putting them in the freezer.

I use chalk pens to write what is in the container, as well as the cooking instructions to make things super-easy when I need it.

Put the olive oil in a large saucepan and place on a medium heat.

Add the diced onions, frozen garlic and diced leek and cook until soft. Once soft, add the frozen peas, spinach and vegetable stock.

Bring to the boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer for eight to ten minutes until everything is soft.

Once soft, remove from the heat and blend the soup until smooth. Leave to cool.

Ready to freeze: Once cool, pour into soup freezer bags or containers and freeze.

Ready to eat: Add the frozen soup to a saucepan and heat through slowly until fully defrosted and piping hot.
