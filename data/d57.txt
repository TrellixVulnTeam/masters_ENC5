THE Bachelor is back again tonight, with Clayton Echard's quest for love continuing.

Episode four of The Bachelor airs Monday night on ABC, and comes one week after Clayton Echard was slammed by fans.

Fans were shocked last week when Clayton and Sarah Hamrick were "forced" to strip down to their underwear for a date.

The pair were told that their clothes had to come off while participating in a Scavenger Hunt during their day date.

The couple looked stunned when Becca Kufrin revealed the stipulations for the game requiring them to walk around downtown Los Angeles in their "skivvies."

Although both Clayton and Sarah admitted that they enjoyed their first date together despite the circumstances, viewers cringed over the "demeaning" outing.

Missouri native Clayton was introduced to Bachelor Nation in Michelle Young's season of the Bachelorette which began airing in October 2021.
