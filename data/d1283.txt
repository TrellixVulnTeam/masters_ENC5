OWNERS of a bar and restaurant in Southampton city center, which is still yet to open, have been given permission to open until 1am.

Concerns were raised about the proposed change of hours at Gin and Olive, at 140 Above Bar Street.

Those living nearby said there would be increased noise as a result. One person who objected to the change said: "The opening of the bar/restaurant outside of current permitted hours will increase the late-night noise in nearby flats and will affect the life quality of the building residents." Councillors discussed the plans and agreed a 1am late opening instead of the proposed 2am plan. In its application, the bar and restaurant said: "The premises will operate a dispersal policy and remind customers to leave the premises quietly with notices at the exit and music being turned down during the final 30 minutes before the premises closed to encourage a winding down before customers leave." The extended opening hours allow the business to trade between 7am to 1am on Thursday to Saturday.
