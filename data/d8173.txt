After a long and tumultuous reign at NBC Universal, Jeff Zucker has been canned. Perhaps best known for engineering the ill-fated Leno-Conan swap, Zucker secured a rumored $35 million exit package.

"It has not been an easy or simple decision," Zucker said in an email to his colleagues. "I have spent my entire adult life here, more than 24 years. This is the only place I have ever worked. The only professional thing I have ever known." In an interview with The New York Times, Zucker conceded that his departure was at the behest of NBC Universal's new parent company Comcastâ€”not of his own volition.

Without a doubt, his legacy will be plagued by his decision to move Jay Leno to primetime. However, his influence at NBC went far beyond last year's debacle. TV critics weigh Zucker's performance:

While I've taken my shots at him over the years, though, I also admire Zucker in a lot of respects. I believe he has a strong big-picture idea of where media are going as a business, and of the pressures on broadcast TV as audiences shrink and old revenue streams are endangered. ... It was when it came to, well, putting TV shows on the air that Zucker had a problem. He was a skilled TV executive who proved his chops running the Today Show, but he never seemed to have the golden gut needed to make strong picks in primetime entertainment, especially dramas and sitcoms. His best moves were tactical: supersizing shows like Friends, expanding Today. But I never got the feeling that he had any aesthetic sense for what scripted shows were right for NBC, or even what he himself liked.
