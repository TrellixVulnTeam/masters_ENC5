An antibody's increased tendency to bind itself at high concentrations limits its stability. As such, scientists must carefully characterize self-interaction when selecting molecules for pharmaceutical applications. However, researchers often have only scarce sample amounts during early-stage development, which prevents them from using many self-interaction analysis methods. Techniques to assess antibody self-interactions with only micrograms of protein are urgently needed.

In this webinar, brought to you by Sartorius, Martin Domnowski, a former researcher at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, will discuss how Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) quickly and reliably identifies antibodies with a strong tendency for self-interaction. Moreover, he will present mitigation strategies for reducing antibody self-interaction, such as specific formulation excipients and rational mutagenesis.
