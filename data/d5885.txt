The Borough Hall in Greenwich is one of five buildings in the capital on the annual at risk list put together by the Theatres Trust.

The Grade II listed building opened its doors in 1939 and was still being used as a home for Greenwich Dance Agency as late as 201 but the Trust says it needs “significant investment” to “bring it up to the standards expected by both current audiences and performers”.

A plan to modernise the council-owned building, with a loss of some original features, was rejected in 2014 and talks with producers Selladoor to reopen its as a 640 seat venue collapsed in 2020.

The Trust says it is “strident in our opinion that we do not consider the collapse of negotiations with one theatre operator to disprove viability” and says it will “continue to champion the future of this historically important theatre”.

Other London venues on the list include theatres in Streatham, Palmers Green, Tottenham and Walthamstow.

Theatres Trust Director Jon Morgan said: “We are now starting to see the true extent of the effects of the pandemic on the UK’s wonderful theatre buildings, hitting well-loved community theatres as well as historic theatres that had been protected by other uses like being bingo halls.

“Theatres Trust would urge anyone who owns a theatre building to consider its long-term value as a performance space and work with us to keep these buildings in use for their communities.”
