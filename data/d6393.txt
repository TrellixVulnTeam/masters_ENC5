Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards held a news conference to respond to an Associated Press investigation that found he was informed within hours of Ronald Greene’s deadly 2019 arrest that troopers engaged in a “violent, lengthy struggle,” yet he stayed silent for two years as state police pushed a much different account that the Black motorist died in a crash at the end of a high-speed chase.

Edwards said Tuesday he would never impede or impair an investigation to help his political fortunes.

Edwards says he remained silent on the case of Ronald Greene at the request of federal investigators who were looking at the case, and that he didn’t see video of Greene’s fatal encounter with police until more than a year after it happened.

Edwards says what happened to Greene was “criminal.”
