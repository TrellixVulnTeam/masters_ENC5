The new Killing Eve trailer has paid beautiful, sapphic tribute to Romeo and Juliet and fans are already “screaming”, “crying” and left with “so many questions”.

On Tuesday (1 February), the trailer dropped for the fourth and final season of Killing Eve, with the show’s official Twitter account tweeting: “Nothing lasts forever.”

The new season, which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will premiere in the US on 27 February, but a UK release date has not yet been announced.

Upon the trailer’s release, one fan “let out a scream so foul and hysteric [they] could be mistaken for a f**king banshee”.

The trailer opens with both Eve and Villanelle discussing violence, with Villanelle telling a therapist: “I killed two people last night after I tried really hard not to.”

Eve on the other hand admits to shooting someone in the hand, which she apparently finds an alluring thought as she asks a man: “You want to have sex?”

In another scene, Eve describes the “fable of the scorpion and the frog”, before the pair share a moment of extreme sapphic sexual tension as Villanelle says: “Maybe you’re the scorpion.”

We see Eve making out with the same man multiple times, as well as Villanelle hooking up with a mystery woman in a church, but viewers are led to believe that the women really are star-crossed lovers with a fish tank scene almost identical to the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet.

Although, as one Twitter user pointed out: “I’ve seen this film before and I didn’t like the ending…”

Series three saw Eve and Villanelle kiss for the first time and left viewers on a cliffhanger, so fans were desperate for them to finally get together in the final series, having endured three seasons of obsession and sexual tension.

As one Twitter user put it: “If they don’t have gay sex I’m going to cause a ruckus.”
