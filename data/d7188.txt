The majority of the public think the investigation into Downing Street parties should continue and only a quarter feel Boris Johnson should remain as Prime Minister, new polling shows.

Four in five Britons also believe Boris Johnson “broke the coronavirus regulations with parties in Downing Street” amid a criminal investigation into the “partygate” scandal, according to surveys carried out by JL Partners.

Out of 2,000 respondents, 55 per cent said the investigation into the Downing Street parties should continue, while 36 per cent believed the country must now move on from the allegations, which have presented the greatest threat to Mr Johnson’s leadership to date.

Seventy-one per cent of 2019 Conservative voters who were surveyed believed Mr Johnson had not followed the rules and 63 per cent of those who supported his party at the last general election felt investigations by Sue Gray and the Metropolitan Police should continue.

On Boris Johnson’s leadership of the country, 61 per cent think he should resign while 25 per cent want him to stay on in his post. In snap polling by Savanta ComRes on Monday, 69 per cent of those surveyed wanted Mr Johnson to resign after his statement in the Commons.
