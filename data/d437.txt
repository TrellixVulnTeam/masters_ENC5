LPBW’s Tori Roloff insisted she is NOT pregnant after fans insisted they spotted a baby bump in a new picture she posted with husband Zach.

The mom-of-two made it clear a third little one is not yet on the way as the Roloff family faces massive backlash for hosting a large Christmas party despite Covid-19 restrictions.

On Tuesday, photographer Monique Serra shared a snap of a pregnant Tori as her husband, Zach Roloff, had his hand on her stomach.

The Little People, Big World star looked gorgeous in a long white lace dress as she stood with her man in a field as they looked at their firstborn, Jackson.

Although the picture is old, no disclaimer was put on the post at first and fans immediately began to assume the couple had another baby on the way.

However, Tori soon took to her Instagram story to share to clear up and confusion.

“NOT PREGNANT,” she wrote in capitalized bold letters over a screenshot of the photo.

The post was made to celebrate the photographer’s new picture presets and her caption was changed to shut down any pregnancy speculation.

“Also this is an old photo I re-edited! Tori isn’t currently pregnant,” photo expert Monique said.

The picture in question was taken shortly before Tori gave birth to their daughter, Lilah, in 2019.

They also share son, Jackson, 3, whom they welcomed in 2017.

Both Tori and Zach have found themselves in some hot water with fans this week after they gathered for a large party at patriarch Matt's home in Oregon despite coronavirus cases in the state continuing to surge.

On Christmas Day, Matt, 59, posted a photo on Instagram with his girlfriend Caryn Chandler, son Zach, daughter-in-law Tori, and their children Jackson, 3, and Lilah, 1.

Caryn’s daughter Brittany and a male attendee were also at Roloff Farms for the holiday.

Matt captioned the photo from the Christmas celebration: “ChaCha puts on the Best holiday celebrations.

“We did Christmas eve open-house-style this year so family and friends could drop in for short visits and grab a photo op to capture the moment while avoiding any large gathering at any one time.”

Fans were still outraged by the mask-less group and slammed the family in the comments section.

One fired off: “Still, not a good idea. I understand you want to be with family, not a good idea.”

A second said: “That's fine to see your family but why weren't ALL of you wearing MASKS which would have given ALL OF YOU SOME PROTECTION for each other since You don't ALL LIVE TOGETHER.”

A third wrote: “You’re not suppose to be mixing households the government has said time and time again super spreaders are happening from these types of events. You should be setting an example @mattroloff!"

This isn’t the first time the Roloff family has been slammed for ignoring Covid guidelines.

Tori was slammed for hosting her daughter’s first birthday in November and making a joke about the coronavirus pandemic.
