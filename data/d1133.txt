"Tonight we can...find the smile again. We have incredibly good news, we can now remove the last coronavirus restrictions in Denmark. Recent weeks have seen very high infection rates, in fact the highest in the entire pandemic. Therefore, it may seem strange and paradoxical that we are now ready to let go of the restrictions", Frederiksen said at a press conference at the end of January, clarifying that the last restrictions will be dropped on 1 February.
