Sweeping statements about how institutions need to “embrace long-term opportunities” because they “generate superior terms” are even more fatuous.

The technology companies that list on the London Stock Exchange and see their shares perform well are those that are able to back up lofty claims with substance. Those that have crashed and burned, such as The Hut Group, Funding Circle, and Deliveroo, deserved to, and probably should never have gone public in the first place.

Their experience should serve as a cautionary tale for businesses eyeing a listing in Britain about the pitfalls of failing to live up to big promises, rather than being interpreted as evidence that the City somehow doesn’t understand high-growth start-ups.

The problem in many cases is that there is often very little actual technology to back up the sky-high valuations that companies and their founders demand other than a phone app.

Tech-enabled doesn’t make a business a real technology company. Too many companies are lumped into the same tech bracket and expected to perform the same. It is facile in the extreme.

The truth is, London’s attractiveness doesn’t depend on reforms that hand founders more power, or changes to transparency. The key difference is the view that the Square Mile takes of tech companies compared with how they are seen on Wall Street where investors are forgiving, often to a fault.

It isn’t surprising that those which have apparently “snubbed” Britain include an electric carmaker and a flying taxi company.

A more robust approach to the bold claims of entrepreneurial founders is the real reason some look at London and then think twice. Ministers can’t change that attitude – but then, nor should they be trying to.
