Manchester United forward Dillon Hoogewerf has left the club to join German Bundesliga side Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach in a permanent deal.

Hoogewerf, 18, had impressed for the club at youth level, but always faced a tricky challenge on his hands given the array of attacking options at the club.

United were not actively looking to get rid of the teenage talent but were happy to facilitate the move for Hoogewerf's benefit due to the attacking depth at academy level.

MEN Sport understand the Dutch forward has left for an undisclosed fee. However, United do have sell-on clauses included in the deal as well as extra payments if he were to leave the club on loan.

Hoogewerf joined the club from Ajax in the summer of 2019 and established himself as a reliable goalscorer at Under-18s level.

In fact, the Dutchman's nine goals in his last season with the Under-18s was only bettered by Charlie McNeill, while his 12 assists were a squad-high.

He made the step-up to the U23s set-up on a permanent basis at the start of the season but often had to wait for appearances off the bench given the intense competition for places.

Hoogewerf signed his first professional contract with the club in March 2020, less than a year after he joined.
