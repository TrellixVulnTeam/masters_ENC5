THE Army has ordered all troops to spend a day reflecting on inclusivity — as Russian soldiers camp on Ukraine’s border.

Tens of thousands will halt training and drills next Tuesday for lectures and group discussions despite fears of war.

General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith ordered a “complete stop” of non-essential, non-operational activity “to consider and reflect on the Army’s culture and inclusivity”.

Its 82,000 regulars will be told to “think differently” — sparking claims of culture wars. It follows a barrage of scandals including claims of murder, rape and bullying.

Former Colonel Richard Kemp slammed the plan, which he called a “navel-gazing and virtue-signalling exercise”.

Attendance is compulsory for all Army personnel.

The six-hour blitz will open with a lecture from ex-SAS commander Gen Carleton Smith and his deputy Army chief Lt Gen Chris Tickell.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace summoned them both for an extraordinary dressing down last year amid fears of a discipline crisis.
