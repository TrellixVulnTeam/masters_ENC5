The ITV presenter revealed that he has tested positive for Covid-19 and is having to isolate at home due to the govern rules.

Phillip Schofield is currently at home isolating after he revealed that he has tested positive with Covid-19.

The presenter confirmed that he had tested positive on Monday night (January 31) by posting the results of his lateral flow test on Instagram,

"Currently just a slightly sore throat," he added.

Why is Phillip Schofield not on This Morning?

Although Phillip was unable to leave his house due to the isolation rules, it didn't stop him from making an appearance during todays show.

He appeared on a video call to say hello to his ITV co-stars, and explained further about why he is absent from the show.

"There are a number of things that I'm disappointed about. Obviously, I'm disappointed that I'm not there. We are a little bit worried about Dancing on Ice because I'm cutting it fine for Dancing on Ice on Sunday.

"Then I'm going to miss Gok's [Wan] dumplings," he added.

Phillip has been replaced at the last minute by Alison Hammond who is presenting the show alongside Rochelle Humes.

When will Phillip Schofield return to This Morning?

Due to Phillip testing positive for Covid-19, it will mean that the ITV presenter will miss This Morning for the rest of the week.

This is due to current rules that state you need a negative test on day five and six in order to leave isolation early.

If those test results are still positive by Sunday, his position on the Dancing On Ice live show will be in doubt.

Phillip was last seen hosting This Morning on Monday with Rochelle and on Sunday night with Holly Willoughby for Dancing on Ice.

Rochelle has replaced Holly for the past two weeks, as she is busy filming for her new show for the BBC.
