It was obvious that even if you believed in the coronavirus as a new virus (as opposed to a rebranding of the flu) that the lockdowns were completely insane and that they would totally destroy the economy and society.

Now, Johns Hopkins University has published a paper saying all of this.

The paper, entitled “A LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF LOCKDOWNS ON COVID-19 MORTALITY,” comes to the conclusion that the lockdowns had “little to no public health effects” while they have “imposed enormous economic and social costs.”

Trillions of dollars worth of wealth has been transferred from the middle class to the richest 1% of the 1%. Children and teenagers are not only failing to develop socially, but are actually developing mental retardation. Their IQs are dropping.

Basically, on the advice of people from Johns Hopkins University, the government completely destroyed every aspect of Western civilization. Now they’re coming out and saying “whoops! Sorry!”

It’s certainly not what I expected!

Meanwhile, Lord Fauci is moving to vaccinate infants – with a vaccine that the creator says doesn’t do anything.
