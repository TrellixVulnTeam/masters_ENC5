To try and get some context and identify a possible reason, we need temperatures for July.

 I don’t know my way around the DWD site but we see what Nick has posted up, we see what DWD says for Summer temps.

Just eyeballing the graphs: Summers over the last 30 odd years are getting warmer and winters are getting colder.

Good news for the People of Germany, Global Warming Theory is debunked.

Bad news for the People of Germany, but you are turning your country into a desert.

And it is impossible to get any more badly bad or badder news than that.

 It really isn’t. Better start thinking how to turn things around.

Proof of the pudding was that awful rainstorm you had recently.

 The rainstorm itself was proof enough of that = a large and strongly convective air column – brought about by the high Lapse Rate you get above dry places such as cities and deserts.

 Then some water vapour got sucked in.

 Result was like a Fire Storm but involving rain

Compounded by the failure of the ground/land/soil/cityscape that the rain fell upon to handle the rain and so cause the ‘flood’

 ‘Rain’ does not equal ‘flood’

 What makes the flood is how the landscape that the rain fell upon handles the rain. Floods are only in the eyes, houses, towns & cities of the beholders.

 And legions of hysterical, doom-fixated and mendacious scientists (and their acolytes plus attendant media) just waiting for such a big phat juicy cherry to fall from the sky

Deserts are for real, for everybody and everything.

 Deserts are total wastelands.

 Go there if you wish but don’t drag everybody else in with you. OK?
