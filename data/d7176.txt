SECURITY were forced to intervene after WWE star Sami Zayn confronted Johnny Knoxville at the Jackass Forever premiere.

The 37-year-old wrestler first clashed with the daredevil after Knoxville declared he was entering the Royal Rumble.

Then during Saturday’s WWE extravaganza, the pair had another run-in during the over-the-top-rope extravaganza.

However, it seems that 37-year-old Zayn was not prepared to leave things in the ring as he became embroiled in a red carpet row on Tuesday night.

Dressed in a sharp suit, the former Intercontinental Champion told reporters they should have been at the Rumble instead of the glitzy Los Angeles film launch.

In a clip that was also shared by WWE, Zayn said: “You guys are around but you weren’t at WWE when Johnny Knoxville showed up, and was messing with me – speak of the devil!”

At that point Knoxville, 50, and his cast mates arrived to confront Zayn, who began to sarcastically applaud his foe and told him he was there to just ‘show respect’.

Zayn said: “Look at him, Johnny Knoxville, the man of the hour! Let’s hear it for Johnny Knoxville.

“Are you getting this, Entertainment Tonight? I’m the bad guy for coming and trying to show respect!”

Suddenly security burst over to grab hold of the grappler as Zayn shouted: “What, you’ve got your goons here. You’re having me tossed out? Haha!”

Knoxville then emerged with a cattle prod to chase off Zayn from the red carpet - but not before the WWE man issued a challenge.

He said: “Put down the cattle prod and then we’ll do something about it. Big star Johnny Knoxville, huh?”

The two men could now be on a collision course for April’s WrestleMania pay-per-view.

Especially after the Jackass legend promised his Royal Rumble opponents ‘haven’t heard the last’ of him after Zayn had eliminated him on Saturday.
