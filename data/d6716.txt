A film crew will be taking over the Bo’ness Hippodrome next week to film a major new series for Amazon/BBC studios.

Hope Street and Hamilton Lane in Bo’ness will be closed for two days, as Nice and Accurate Productions take over the historic building, which is Scotland’s oldest purpose-built picture-house.

It is understood that the filming is for ‘Good Omens 2’, the new Amazon/BBC production, starring David Tennant and Michael Sheen, which is currently being filmed on location around Scotland.

The company says they will be using the Bo’ness Hippodrome on Monday, February 14 and Tuesday, February 15.

They will also be using space inside the library and town hall to accommodate extras as well as a couple of local businesses on Hope Street, although their base will be in the museum at Bo’ness and Kinneil Railway.

There will be a road closure in place on Hope Street and Hamilton Lane from 6am on Monday 14 until 9pm on Tuesday, February 15 with single yellow line and bay suspensions on South Street and Market Street from Saturday, February 12 – Wednesday, February 16.

The production company says they have been speaking and liaising with residents and businesses in the last couple of weeks to ensure that any issues are dealt with prior to filming.
