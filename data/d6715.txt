A Russian military plane carried almost 300 animals flew over Glasgow this morning, with locals left stunned by the sound of the powerful aircraft.

Residents were woken to loud engines flying over the city as the Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft made its way through Scotland with hundreds of cats and dogs inside.

It comes as part of a Kabul Small Animal Rescue mission that aimed to take the pets to safety in Vancouver.

Flight Radar 24, a real-time commercial aircraft flight tracker map, said the flight was due to make one more tech stop in Reykjavik before landing at Vancouver International Airport.

The flight flew over the outskirts of the city towards Loch Lomond around 2.45am.

Flight Radar 24 said: "300 dogs and cats from the Kabul Small Animal Rescue (KSAR) are back in the air on their way from Kabul to Vancouver.

"They'll make one more tech stop in Reykjavik before making their way to YVR airport."

Earlier this year we told you about the 'deafening' moment when two US Air Force jets flew low over a Scots town leaving residents 'frightened'.

Stunned Lanarkshire locals couldn't believe their eyes when the two fighter planes flew over the region at around 5.35pm on Thursday night.

One resident in Blantyre caught the moment the second jet passed by his house.

In the video the loud airplane can be seen powering low through the sky with red lights on, below the clouds.

As it quickly fires out of shot, the thundering noise of the jet can still be heard several moments later.
