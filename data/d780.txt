John Douillard, DC, CAP, interviews Dr. Satchin Panda, author of The Circadian Code, on circadian rhythms and optimizing your diet, exercise, and sleep.

In this episode of the Ayurveda Meets Modern Science podcast, host John Douillard, DC, CAP, interviews Dr. Satchin Panda, author of The Circadian Code. Dr. Satchin Panda is a professor at The Salk Institute in California. His lab studies how circadian rhythm is an integral part of metabolic health and longevity.

Check out his lab’s app, myCircadianClock, which studies the epidemiology of daily patterns of activity, sleep, and food intake.

There are always new diets that become viral overnight, but a circadian rhythm diet, which is similar to intermittent fasting, follows a time-restricted eating schedule that limits calorie intake to an eight to twelve-hour window. Eating within this window can help balance your daily rhythms and increase longevity.

To follow a circadian diet it is best to avoid food three to four hours before bed and one to two hours after waking up. In addition, practice eating a bigger breakfast and lunch, and a smaller dinner to help fire up your digestion while you are awake.

Have you ever wondered what time is the best to exercise? According to circadian science, afternoon exercise might be better for your rhythms. You’re less likely to get hurt and more likely to reduce blood sugar levels.

Ayurvedic practitioners, on the other hand, prescribe morning exercise for improved parasympathetic tone and endurance.

Modern technology has made it harder to get restful night’s sleep. From blue lights and staring at bright screens all day, our circadian clocks are struggling to get enough melatonin to help us sleep soundly at night.

5 ways to increase your melatonin , and boost your zzzs:

· If using LED light bulbs, try an orange bulb instead of a blue bulb

· Use indirect light or natural sunlight when possible

· Avoid going to stores at night, as they are extremely bright

· Reduce the brightness on your technology

· Take melatonin a couple of hours after your last meal
