“Stay warm. It’s a cold one out there today.” – Congressman Murray from Parks & Recreation.

Yes, its a cold one out there. But the Biden Administration is engaging in reducing fossil fuel supply and pushing towards “green” energy such as inefficient solar panels, eagle-killing wind turbines, and ocean turbines.

As a consequence, natural gas futures are up 93% from January 1, 2021 while coal futures are up 133% and WTI Crude spot price is up 82%.

Any wonder why food prices are up 40%?

Stay warm. It’s a cold one out there today. And The Federal government doesn’t care.
