TOM Parker has asked his fans to pray for him as they light a candle during the new moon to help in his cancer battle.

The Wanted singer posted a heartwarming photo with his wife Kelsey and asked fans to "light a candle and say a prayer for me".

Tom, 33, who was diagnosed with the terminal inoperable illness last year - has been undergoing intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment.

He gazed up at his wife who is sitting on his lap and wearing sunglasses, in the moving Instagram post.

"Calling all my amazing followers ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨," he started on the Instagram post.

"I would love for you all to get involved tonight and light a candle and say a prayer for me.

"It’s a new moon and supreme number 02.02.22 ✨ it’s a powerful day to manifest with the universe."

He added: "So let’s all heal together. At 6pm I would love everyone to light a candle and say this out loud.

“I let go of what no longer serves me for the highest good and in divine order.

Thank you universe for all that I have, all that I am and all that I will ever be!

"May Tom Parker be strong of mind and body and completely cured and healed.

May his body return to the best health and completely free from dis-ease.

"I call on angels, guides and ancestors to help support Tom in his healing journey and please awaken Tom’s heart and mind to give him the power, strength and healing that he needs on this journey to complete health. 🙏🏽"

The rest of the prayer read: "May his family be adorned with the love and strength that they need to enable them to support Tom too.

"I am supporting Tom Parker with love and light! And surrounding him with joy and positivity.

"Thank you 🙏🏽 And so it is …. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌟🌟❤️❤️🌟🌟🌟❤️🌟❤️❤️❤️” written by @seaspiritandstones."

The star was told he had a grade four glioblastoma and that the plan would only prolong his life, with a 12 to 18 months life expectancy.

Astonishingly, after six rounds of chemotherapy and 30 radiotherapy sessions, Tom was able to reveal that his outlook is considerably more positive.

Things have been so far improved for the singer that he was able to get on stage with his The Wanted bandmates on last month's Strictly The Real Full Monty.



The Bolton lad — who has a daughter Aurelia, two, and son Bodhi, 11 months, with Kelsey — said in TV documentary Inside My Head in October: “You’ll always be classed as terminal.

“They give you 12 to 18months of survival. But that’s the general statistics. Everyone we’ve ­spoken to has been way, way beyond that.

“Now, we’re aiming to be cancer free by March. That’s the aim. This disease is always there.

"You might have residual cells but just not active. So, we’ll just carry on, just crack on and see where we get to.”

For six weeks the star was having to travel daily from his family home in Kent to Guy’s Hospital in London for gruelling radiation sessions — only getting any respite at weekends.

At one point his weight dropped by a third, to just 7st 7lb.
