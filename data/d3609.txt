Former Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL) will serve as a guide for President Biden’s Supreme Court nominee during the Senate confirmation process, the New York Times reports.

“Mr. Jones, who left the Senate in 2021 and was on a short list to serve as Mr. Biden’s attorney general, will be serving as a so-called Senate sherpa for Mr. Biden’s nominee… Sherpas have borrowed their nicknames from people who live in the Himalaya Mountains. They are known for their ability to guide travelers through hazardous terrain, including at high altitudes and in frigid conditions.”
