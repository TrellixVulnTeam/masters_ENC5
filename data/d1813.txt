A NEW mum has revealed the strict set of rules she has given her family now that she’s just had a baby.

TikTok user Kay said everyone is banned from changing her nappy but her and her partner, and no one is allowed to discipline her either.

Speaking on her @_mamatoone account, she said: “Boundaries I set with our families for our daughter from the start.”

The first rule is that “nobody is allowed to change her diaper (only mom & dad).”

Secondly, family members have to ask the little girl’s permission to hug and kiss them.

Next, Kay said she required her family to wear masks around her daughter when she was a baby and they were at home.

Finally, she added: “No one disciplines but mom & dad.”

She explained: “Boundaries with family are needed.”

Lots of people had their own views on her list of rules - with some disagreeing but others thought it was fair.

One person supported her requirements, and said: “I agree with all!”

One said: “I agree but my whole family disciplines our kids.”

A third queried: “What is your reasoning on the diaper rule?” to which Kay replied: “Mainly respecting her body & privacy & also protecting her + setting a boundary for our families not to get too comfy with her.”

A four added: “Same except the diaper. My mom has been a huge help for me. But nobody else can change his diaper.”
