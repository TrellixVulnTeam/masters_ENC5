Exactly why Trump is shifting the focus to this latter option is a valid question to ask. Trump has pulled back on such admissions before, and his critics often believe itâ€™s because he or someone around him has recognized the potential legal jeopardy that accompanied them. Trump faces not only a congressional Jan. 6 investigation in which some are floating potential crimes Trump might have committed, but also a criminal investigation in Fulton County, Ga. That latter probe involves evidence that Trump was far less concerned about actual evidence of fraud than with getting something to lay a predicate for overturning his loss.
