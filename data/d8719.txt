Simon Cowell has broken his silence on his second horror bike smash saying that he’s ‘a bit of a nutter’ after it was reported that was ‘lucky to be alive’.

The 62-year-old has vowed to wear a helmet from now on, after his latest crash left him with a broken arm.

Speaking to the Mail Online, he said: ‘I’m OK. I’m feeling much better thank you. It happened just round the corner.

‘I’m a bit of a nutter. I’ll definitely wear a helmet next time.’

This is the second time the Britain’s Got Talent creator has fallen from his electric bike – 18 months after his original fall saw him break his back.

The star skidded at 20 mph, then flew over his handlebars and landed in the middle of the road, reports The Sun.

This fall saw Simon receive facial cuts, a suspected concussion, and a broken arm.

According to eyewitnesses, his face was covered in blood, and many passers-by gathered around him to help after his bike slipped on a wet patch in the road.

On Wednesday, Simon was spotted stepping out with his fiancee Lauren Silverman, sporting a bright green cast that had been signed by his son Eric.

The youngster had signed his name in black ink alongside images of the family’s dogs Diddly and Squiddly.

The music star is however refusing to give up the bike, much to his Lauren’s dismay.

Speaking to The Sun, a source said: ‘Simon is as stubborn as a mule. He won’t give up his precious E bikes for love nor money.

‘He actually had his bike accident when Lauren was in New York – the poor thing was obviously beside herself with worry.

‘She’d rather him not ride again, clearly, but there’s no use telling Simon Cowell what to do.

‘The compromise is that he will ride only when wearing a helmet. He’s lucky to be alive and shouldn’t push his luck.
