The pair formed a close friendship during seven years together at Spurs and Dier paid tribute to “my brother” after Dele signed for Everton on deadline day.

Dier and Dele shared a special bond during their time at Tottenham, were key members of the Mauricio Pochettino era and were both part of the England team that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2018.

They were also close off the pitch, going on holidays together and even featuring on Celebrity Googlebox.

Dele joined Everton on a free transfer, leaving Spurs after 67 goals in 269 games in seven years at the club after joining as a teenager from MK Dons for £5million in 2015.

Dier joined Tottenham just before Dele in 2014 from Sporting Lisbon and has paid tribute to his friend and former team-mate.

Taking to Instagram, Dier posted: “Thanks for the memories my brother... so far.”

Dele posted an emotional farewell to Spurs, saying: “It’s the end of the chapter but not the book.

“I’ve had an incredible seven years at Tottenham and have made some lifelong friends that now feel like family! I want to wish my brothers all the best for the rest of the season and more.

“To the fans, I want to say thank you. We’ve had some incredible moments together that will stay with me for the rest of my life and I will never forget the amazing support you have given me.

“Playing for you was a dream come true and you will always be in my heart.

“I want to give a special mention to Mauricio and his staff for their trust and guidance in the early part of my career at Spurs, which gave me the confidence and platform to show what I can do.

“I love you all and wish you the best for the future! Dele out.”
