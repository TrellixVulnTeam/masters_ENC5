How many times in recent years did crooks figure they'd get the best of their victims with no problem? That they'd probably just lay down and take it? And certainly that their victims would never arm themselves with guns, much less fire them?

By this point, we've certainly lost count.

But we have for you yet another account of a crook who's not reading the news — or maybe just can't read. Either way, it once again meant a very bad day for the bad guy.

Police in Rainier, Oregon — just across the river from Washington state and about an hour north of Portland — responded to a report of burglary in progress at a residence in the 600 block of West C Street early Sunday morning, Oregon State Police reported.

When officers arrived, they confronted an armed suspect who was eventually detained without incident, police said.

Oh, but there's a bit more to the story.

Turns out the preliminary investigation revealed the suspect committed a home invasion robbery and exchanged gunfire with the homeowner, police said.

The suspect was shot — and the homeowner was not injured, police said.

The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for his injuries, cops said.

While KOIN-TV reported that the suspect’s condition was not released, KGW-TV reported that the suspect is expected to survive.

State police said the Columbia County Major Crimes team was activated, and lead agencies for the ongoing investigation are the Rainer Police Department and the Oregon State Police, with assistance from the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office and Columbia County District Attorney’s Office.

What did observers have to say?

As you might imagine, folks reacting so far to the results of the shootout were decidedly happy for the homeowner.

"The alert that I read sounded good," one commenter said. "The homeowner won!"

Another commenter asked, "Where is [Kyle] Rittenhouse when needed[?]"
