David Moyes’ second spell may have been built on an improvement in the market as the club moved away from the kind of spending that saw Manuel Pellegrini waste millions but, frankly, not to have brought anyone in amid a push for Champions League qualification is understandably frustrating.

Clearly, that does not mean West Ham can’t finish in the top four but it certainly makes their task harder with their small squad a major concern when heading into the second-half of the season.

Here, then, is a round-up of West Ham’s January transfer window.

The subject of £60m bid, Darwin Nunez will remain at Benfica until the summer at least after West Ham’s late offer was rejected.

Another big-name forward targeted by Moyes last month, Leeds United rejected a big offer from West Ham for the Brazilian late on in the window.

Declan Rice’s midfield partner for England, Phillips had been targeted by West Ham in what would have been a shock £50m raid.

Leeds, however, rejected that offer too.

West Ham had identified the central defender as a potential option earlier in the January window but were ultimately unable to agree a fee with Liverpool.

On deadline day, Phillips joined Championship side Bournemouth on loan for the rest of the season.

Having proven such a success last season, Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard always seemed like a natural target for West Ham.

Still, despite the fact his deal runs out at the end of the season, the England international will be kept at Old Trafford.

West Ham pursued a loan deal for the Marseille defender but the French club were only ever likely to accept a permanent offer, keeping him in Ligue 1.
