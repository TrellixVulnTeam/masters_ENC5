Yes, he understood the longing I felt scrolling online through the full complement of bagged media for every purpose, all bearing the prestigious Royal Horticultural Society imprint. But those products, created by Melcourt Industries Limited, are marketed only to U.K. consumers, not exported.

In the United States, we aren’t there yet with seedling or other specialty mixes, Dr. Jackson acknowledged. “The first discussions of going peat-free in the U.K. are now 20 years old, so they have had a long time to ponder,” he said.

But the voluntary targets set there in 2011 to end the sale of peat in their home-garden products by 2020 have slipped by. Last December, a ban effective in 2024 was announced, with a 2030 timeline on products for commercial growers.

No such mandates are in force here or in Canada, the source of the vast majority of peat for North American horticulture, and it is still expanding production to meet intense market pressure for soilless media. Canada is home to an estimated 27 percent of the world’s peatlands, 0.03 percent of which are currently harvested or have been, according to the Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association. Only 22 percent of U.K. peatlands are in “a near natural or rewetted condition,” according to the Office for National Statistics there.

Peat bans and other environmental efforts are not the only triggers causing what Dr. Jackson calls “a perfect storm” of soilless-media demand, forecast to increase as much as fourfold by 2050. The cannabis boom is another factor, as are industry shifts to growing crops like berries and citrus fruit in soilless growing systems, rather than in the field. And so is the pandemic-fueled gardening boom.
