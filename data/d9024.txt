Sen. Jeff Merkley on Wednesday slammed United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres’ decision to attend the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing despite diplomatic boycotts by multiple nations, including the U.S., over accusations of human rights violations by the Chinese government.

“The U.N. has basically failed human rights,” Merkley (D-Ore.) said in an interview with POLITICO, citing China’s record on abuse, surveillance and freedom of speech. “It’s shameful for António Guterres to appear at the games.”

In response to Merkley's criticism, a spokesperson for Guterres said that the secretary-general hopes to meet with high-level diplomats in China after the Olympics.

"The secretary-general considers the Olympic Games as an important expression of unity, mutual respect and cooperation between different cultures, religions and ethnicities," deputy press secretary for the secretary-general Farhan Haq said to POLITICO in an email. "The secretary-general is hopeful that the present contacts between the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Chinese Mission in Geneva will allow for the invitation to the High Commissioner to visit China, including Xinjiang, to lead to a credible mission after the Olympics."
