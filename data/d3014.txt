All charts and tables below reflect the data release on 01/28/2022 from the VAERS website, which includes U.S. and foreign data, and is updated through: 1/21/2022

*Note that the total number of deaths associated with the COVID-19 vaccines is more than double the number of deaths associated with all other vaccines combined since the year 1990.

The slide below was taken from an FDA document from October 22, 2020 and provides a list of possible adverse event outcomes related to the Covid-19 vaccines.

The following table lists the number of adverse events found in the VAERS data which match the outcomes listed above:

Average Annual Adverse Events by Symptom for COVID-19 Vaccines as a Multiple of All Other Vaccines Combined since 1990

These set of figures compare the COVID19 vaccine to the traditional Flu vaccines. ‘Risk of Death’ percentages depend on the ‘# of Vaccinations’ data, which is only approximate, and was pulled from the CDC’s report on Flu vaccination coverage for the 2019-2020 season, and from Our World in Data for the COVID19 vaccinations.

Covid19 vaccinations through 5/31/2021 vs. Flu vaccinations 7/1/2019 – 5/31/2020 (last complete flu season)

Risk of dying from COVID vaccine is 171 times greater than Flu Vaccine

Risk of adverse reaction from COVID vaccine is 56 times greater than Flu Vaccine
