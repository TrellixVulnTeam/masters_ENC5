Jennings took to Twitter Wednesday to "own up to" several "unartful and insensitive" tweets that recently came to light as he prepares to debut as the interim host on "Jeopardy!" following the November death of longtime game show host Alex Trebek.

"I just wanted to own up to the fact that over the years on Twitter, I've definitely tweeted some unartful and insensitive things," Jennings, 46, began. "Sometimes they worked as jokes in my head and I was dismayed to see how they read on screen."

Jennings has faced growing backlash over a 2014 tweet that read, "Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair." Despite many viewers dubbing the tweet "deeply offensive," Jennings refused to take down the post in 2018.

"In the past, I'd usually leave bad tweets up just so they could be dunked on," he explained Wednesday. "At least that way they could lead to smart replies and even advocacy. Deleting them felt like whitewashing a mistake."

But, Jennings said he believes "that practice may have given the impression I stand by every failed joke I've ever posted here." That perception is "not at all" correct, he added.

"Sometimes I said dumb things in a dumb way and I want to apologize to people who were (rightfully!) offended," he tweeted. "It wasn't my intention to hurt anyone, but that doesn't matter: I screwed up, and I'm truly sorry."

Other controversial tweets from Jennings include a 2015 joke about a terminal "Star Wars" fan who viewed “The Force Awakens” before he died and a now-deleted tweet mocking President Trump's son Barron Trump in 2011.

"If 2020 has taught us anything, it's that we should be kinder to one another," he continued. "I look forward to heading into 2021 with that in mind."

Jennings will be one of several interim hosts before the show decides on a permanent replacement, "Jeopardy!" announced in a statement in November.

"There will only ever be one Alex Trebek, but I'm honored to be helping 'Jeopardy!' out with this in January," Jennings responded with a respectful Twitter bow to Trebek, who died from stage 4 pancreatic cancer at age 80 on Nov. 8.

Earlier this year, Jennings claimed the title of "Jeopardy! Greatest of All Time" in a prime-time event. He also holds the all-time records for most consecutive games won (74) and highest winnings in regular-season play ($2,520,700).

The first week of guest-hosted shows will air the week of Jan. 11, starting with Jennings.
