Silicon Valley is home to some of the world's largest technology giants, Intel, Apple, and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.

Democratic Representative Ro Khanna represents that influential and wealthy part of California in Congress, and in his new book, "Dignity in a Digital Age," he says tech companies should stop concentrating their jobs in cities like San Francisco, and create employment opportunities across the entire country.

And Congressman Ro Khanna joins us now.

What are you referring to there?
