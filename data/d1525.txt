Health secretary Sajid Javid has announced the government’s U-turn on mandatory Covid vaccines for NHS health and social care workers.

Javid faced pressure to scrap the requirement for health workers in England to be double-vaccinated by 1 April amid fears it will lead to a major staffing crisis.

In the Commons, he told MPs that Britain has passed the peak of the winter spike in Covid cases and that the Omicron variant is “intrinsically less severe” than previous strains.

He added: “While vaccination remains our very best line of defence against Covid-19, I believe that it is no longer proportionate to require vaccination as a condition of deployment through statute.”

It comes as the Covid infections reported on the government website soared by more than 800,000 following a reporting change.

The government Covid dashboard now includes reinfections in total cases which until recently were only included in daily updates and not the cumulative total.
