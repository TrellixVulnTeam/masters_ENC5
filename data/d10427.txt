CNN’s resident potato Brian Stelter said people trusting Joe Rogan over CNN is a much bigger problem than Spotify.

A quick recap of what the “newsroom at CNN” has looked like in the last year:
• Producer Rick Saleeby forced out for soliciting underage photos and is under criminal investigation
• Jeffrey “Zoomin” Toobin exposed himself during a virtual meeting with colleagues



Spotify announced a new ‘content advisory’ warning for podcasts that discuss Covid-19 after the left-wing media apparatus called for Rogan to be censored.

The firestorm started a few months ago when Joe Rogan told his audience of millions of listeners that he treated his Covid infection with Ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies and a vitamin drip.

Rogan has also interviewed Dr. Malone, the inventor of the mRNA vaccine gene therapy.

Apparently Rogan is now “dangerous” for engaging in political discourse on his podcast.

Brian Stelter said CNN is much more trustworthy than Joe Rogan (try not to laugh).

CNN’s viewership has plummeted 90% from last year in a critical demographic.

According to a new report by The Daily Mail, CNN averaged 548,000 viewers in the first week of January compared to 2.7 million viewers the same week in 2021.

The network’s owner, Jeff Zucker, has been under fire for protecting perverts and pedophiles at his company.
