Lee was a member of the 3,000m relay title team at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics. Still just a raw teenager then, Lee didn't qualify for individual races then, and only got into the relay races. Over the years, though, Lee said she has developed into a much more mature athlete on and off the ice.
