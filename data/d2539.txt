In the midst of various restrictions throughout the United States, (and the rest of the world for that matter,) due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some people feel that such restrictions are not enough.

One example is the New West Charter School in Los Angeles, which not only forbade any unvaccinated students from attending class but also forced them to stand outside behind police tape. And if that wasn’t enough, the unvaccinated students were threatened with suspension if they didn’t leave the school grounds.

Another example is an editorial published in the Salt Lake Tribune, which called for deploying the National Guard to prevent the unvaccinated from going anywhere. Such drastic action was part of a call to mandate vaccination throughout Utah.

Of course, Democrats are all for such extreme and unconstitutional measures. Here are some examples:
• 59 percent of Democrats support forcing the unvaccinated to stay home at all times, except for emergencies. I guess Democrats expect the unvaccinated to order their groceries online.
• 55 percent of Democrats approve of levying fines against anyone who chooses not to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Such a measure reminds me of the individual mandate under Obamacare.
• 48 percent of Democrats endorse imposing fines or imprisoning anybody who questions the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Will Congress or any state legislature be willing to go that far? Would a jury be willing to convict anyone who questions how effective vaccines are? As I mentioned in my article from last week, it’s actually unsafe not to question the experts.
• 47 percent of Democrats support a government tracing program to track anybody who refuses the vaccines. How much would such a program cost the taxpayers?
• 45 percent of Democrats agree with forcing the unvaccinated to live in “designated facilities,” such as the internment camps Australia established. So apparently they want to one-up Nazi Germany.
• 29 percent of Democrats favor the state temporarily removing parental custody of children if the parents refuse to get COVID-19 vaccines. Would there be enough foster homes across the country to accommodate all those children?

Naturally, a majority of Republicans are opposed to such measures.

In fact, a majority of Americans are opposed to these extreme measures, as indicated by a series of protests against vaccination mandates in some parts of the country, as well as the Supreme Court striking down Biden’s plan for requiring vaccinations for any workplace that has 100 or more employees.

And that is why Republicans will take back control of Congress come November.
