“At this time I can no longer support the PM. His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues. I have submitted a letter of no confidence,” he said.

Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary and close ally of Johnson hit out at the rebels.

“The defining mission of the PM & this government is to level up the whole of the UK,” she said.

“On the very day we are setting out steps to make this happen, a handful of egos want to make it all about them. It’s selfish, doing Labours work and it’s really not helping their constituents.”

If 54 Tory MPs submit a letter to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench Tory 1922 committee, then a no confidence vote in Johnson’s leadership will be held.

Only Brady knows how many letters he has received. And an unknown number could have put a letter in without announcing it in public.

Other backbenchers who have called on the PM to quit include former Brexit secretary David Davis and former chief whip Andrew Mitchell.
