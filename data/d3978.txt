Chinese officials announced that by the end of Jan. 28, there were 12 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province. So far, at least 34 people have been verified with it.

However, the Chinese regime’s official data on the COVID-19 pandemic has been questioned for its accuracy.

According to many videos posted online, on the evening of the 27th, the local authority sent hundreds of buses to carry nearly 10,000 people to the centralized isolation point.

The preliminary epidemic investigation shows that Hangzhou’s current round of infections stems from the Huierte China Catering Equipment company located in the Changjiang community, with 297 employees. The first confirmed person attended the company’s annual meeting. Also, the Changjiang Xiyuan community next to the company once held a wedding banquet, and many positive infections stem from it.

As Chinese media reported, the Hangzhou municipal authorities first listed Changjiang Community and Changjiang Xiyuan as closed areas. They then decided to transfer all personnel to a centralized isolation point. According to the Hangzhou Municipal Government, there are 95 buildings in the closed area, with 2,662 households and 9,322 people. As of 3:00 PM on the 28th, a total of 336 buses have been dispatched to transport 9,218 people.

The current round of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hangzhou is of the Omicron variant, which has spilled over to Shangrao in Jiangxi, Anshun in Guizhou, and Luotian in Hubei. In addition, there are more than ten cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and more, posing a headache to the Chinese regimes’ “zero-COVID” policy.
