Former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was so desperate to leave the Gunners that he took a 73% pay-cut in order to join Barcelona.

The 32-year-old completed a move to the Camp Nou on deadline day, signing an 18-month deal with the Catalans.

Aubameyang had 18 months to run on his Arsenal contract but the Gunners agreed to rip up his deal, given no European club had offered to take on his £300,000-a-week salary.

The Gunners felt that the short-term financial hit of allowing Aubameyang to leave on a free would pay off in the long-term but despite being available for free, the former Dortmund ace still had to compromise in order to get his move to Barcelona.

The La Liga giants remain in financial disarray, despite acquiring a huge loan.

The Catalans had to offload Philippe Coutinho to Aston Villa in order to make way for new arrivals and Ousmane Dembele was urged to accept a loan move to Paris Saint-Germain on deadline day, though the Frenchman remained in Spain.

The club certainly could not afford to match Aubameyang’s £300,000-a-week wages and though the Gabon international was aware he would have to take a pay-cut, the Guardian report that he had to take a whopping 73% decrease in salary in order to seal his move to the Camp Nou.

It means Aubameyang will earn a basic £80,000-a-week in Spain until the end of the season.

The striker then hopes to negotiate a new salary for the 2022/23 season but much will depend on how the Catalans fare in the remainder of the campaign.
