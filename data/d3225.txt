An earthquake drill will be held by Home Front Command in Modi'in-Maccabim-Reut on Wednesday at 10:05 a.m.

The drill will include a short sound which will sound like a siren and an announcement over public address systems saying "earthquake" repeatedly. If an actual alert is activated, an additional rising and falling siren will be heard.
