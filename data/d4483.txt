A shooting outside a school in a Minneapolis suburb left one student dead and another in critical condition on Tuesday, according to the authorities, who said that the assailant or assailants had fled and were still at large.

The gunfire erupted around noon near the entrance of the South Education Center in Richfield, Minn., a school that serves about 200 students with special and alternative-learning needs from prekindergarten to age 21 that is about 10 miles south of Minneapolis, the police said during a news conference.

It was not immediately clear what had precipitated the shooting or whether the students had been targeted. The victims, whose names had not been released by Tuesday evening, were found on the sidewalk. the police said.

As a precaution, several other schools in the area were placed under a lockdown that was later lifted, Jay Henthorne, the police chief in Richfield, said during the news conference.
