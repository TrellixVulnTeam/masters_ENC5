Former President George Bush donated to Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) this January, according to a report.

Bush gave the legal maximum contribution of $5,800 to Cheney, the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, who has allied herself with Democrats. According to Breitbart this was originally reported in the New York Times. (The Slimes)

Cheney, was ousted from GOP conference chair 2021 and is no longer recognized by the Wyoming GOP, has outraised her Trump-endorsed opponent, Harriet Hageman. Hageman has earned the support of America First heavy hitters.

Donald Trump’s Save America PAC has reportedly donated the maximum $5,000 to Hageman, and venture capitalist and Republican megadonor Peter Thiel reportedly hosted a fundraiser on Wednesday for her. Hageman is very much America First.

According to Breitbart News “A January straw poll, among GOP activists, conducted by the Wyoming Republican State Central Committee revealed Hageman holds a commanding lead over Cheney. By secret ballot, Hageman won 59 votes, and Cheney was given just 6, a 53-point victory by Hageman.”

“Cheney’s history as a member of Congress includes voting to impeach Trump, voting to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress for not appearing before the partisan, investigatory January 6 committee, and joining Democrats for the January 6 festivities at the Capitol building.”

Bush and Cheney who bore much responsibility for the deadly Iraq intervention are neocon globalists. They put global and financial interests ahead of the best interests of America. Perhaps the base will vote Cheney out sending a message that the Republican party is no longer controlled by Neocons but rather by Patriotic conservatives.
