In 2018, “Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade acknowledged that he inadvertently donated roughly $600 to the Trump campaign when he purchased Trump-themed Christmas tree ornaments online as a gift for his friends and family members in November 2016. “I had no idea that would go to a campaign contribution,” he said at the time. “Even if I wasn’t in this business, I would never be giving contributions out to people — especially after an election.”
