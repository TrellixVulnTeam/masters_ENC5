Police have charged 27 people over a riot that broke out after the death of a teenager in Swansea last year.

A vigil held for Ethan Powell, 19, in Waun Wen Road, Mayhill, on May 20 2021, descended into chaos when a mob began torching cars, vandalising homes and attacking police.

The youngster had died two days earlier at the home he shared with his grandmother.

An inquest held on Monday confirmed he had collapsed after an “unintentional drug overdose”.

An investigation into the disorder has now seen dozens of people aged 15 to 44 accused of offences including rioting and arson with intent to endanger life.

They are due to appear at Swansea Magistrates’ Court in March.

Chief Superintendent Trudi Meyrick said: “The investigation team were resolute in their commitment to fully investigate the disorder that happened that night.

“Residents of Mayhill were subjected to terrible scenes of disorder which caused serious harm and distress to the community.

“The judicial process will now run its course and we await the outcome of that process.”

South Wales Police (SWP) publicly apologised last month after locals said it took officers too long to respond to their calls for help and that they had felt “abandoned”.

An independent inquiry found there had been “significant failings” by the force and recommended it carries out a more thorough investigation into its actions that night.
