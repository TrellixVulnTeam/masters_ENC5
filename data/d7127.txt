MAURICIO POCHETTINO has reportedly told friends he will be leaving Paris Saint-Germain this summer alerting Manchester United.

The Argentine is expected to leave the Parisians a year before his contract is due to expire.

According to Foot Mercato, the former Tottenham coach is fed up with questions over his style of play, as well as the performance levels of his star-studded team.

The failure to sign Tanguy Ndombele from Spurs has also put a strain on his relationship with sporting director Leonardo.

Ndombele instead joined his former club Lyon on loan.

Le Parisien are also reporting that PSG have been looking at the possibility of replacing Pochettino before the end of the season.

And that a return to the Premier League could be on the cards for the 49-year-old with Man Utd interested in appointing him as their permanent manager.

Ralf Rangnick is currently in charge of United's first-team on an interim basis, but whether he keeps the post beyond this summer is yet to be seen.

In the event of Pochettino being sacked, PSG could turn to three-time Champions League-winning manager Zinedine Zidane.

The French icon was being touted as a potential replacement for Pochettino when United tried to prize him away from PSG in November.

But a move failed to materialise and Pochettino stayed put.
