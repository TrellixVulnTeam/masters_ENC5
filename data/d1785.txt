IF you've got a phobia of thunderstorms, then you'll know even the slightest bit of rain can leave you feeling faint.

But why not swap quaking in fear for trembling in pleasure instead?

Because if you're looking to tackle your fears once and for all, then the Thunderstorm sex position is the way to go.

To try it out at home, the move involves the woman leaning over a table while standing on her tip-toes with her legs apart.

Granted, this sex position is much easier for us girls - as the man has to stand behind and lift his leg up onto the table.

While you grip onto the table for support, your partner holds onto your waist while you rock back and forth together.

And trust us, you're guaranteed to forget all about the thunder and lighting outside.

For more ways to spice up things in the bedroom, The Fixer is perfect for make-up sex while the Throwback Thursday is ideal for when you're feeling lazy.

And the Magic Bullet sex position promises intense orgasms when you can’t be bothered to put in the effort.

Plus the V For Victory sex position is the new move for couples to try this Valentine’s Day for guaranteed orgasms.
