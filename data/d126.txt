Since seizing power on February 1, 2021, the military regime has used force against the opposition to its rule and failed to secure diplomatic recognition.

February 1 marks a year since the military seized control of Myanmar.

The generals made their move on the day the new parliament – elected the previous November – was due to sit for the first time and all the politicians had congregated in the capital Naypyidaw.

They first detained Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s elected leader, and senior members of her government before announcing their coup.

The move prompted widespread anger in a country, which had been making a gradual, if sometimes stuttering shift, towards democracy.

The military has responded with characteristic force and nearly 1,500 people have now been killed in the crackdown, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a non-profit that has been tracking the unrest.

Frustrated with the lack of progress, some people have taken up arms, and the National Unity Government, established by elected lawmakers and pro-democracy groups, has set up the People’s Defence Force.

A year since the coup and with little sign of international consensus to restore the civilian government, the situation looks increasingly precarious.

Here is a timeline of events over the past 12 months.

The military detains 76-year-old Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy, which had been reelected in a landslide election in November 2020.

A state of emergency is declared and army chief Min Aung Hlaing takes control. Aung San Suu Kyi’s location is unknown.

Police are accused of using excessive and lethal force against protesters in Naypyidaw. Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, 20, is shot in the head and dies 10 days later. The military bans gatherings in townships across 10 regions.

Tens of thousands of people in Yangon and elsewhere in Myanmar join the anti-coup protests, the biggest crowd since the generals’ power grab after the United States imposed sanctions on coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and several other senior generals for their roles in the coup.

United Nations ambassador, Kyaw Moe Tun calls for the “strongest possible action” against the military regime and ends his UN speech with the three-fingered salute adopted by the protesters.

The UN Security Council unanimously calls for a reversal of the military coup in Myanmar and condemns the military’s violence against peaceful protesters.

A military statement said all outstanding charges against the man once dubbed by Time magazine “The Face of Buddhist Terror” has been dropped.

In an unprecedented move, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) excludes Min Aung Hlaing from their summit, saying the military has failed to make progress on its plan to end the crisis.
