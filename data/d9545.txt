For several months “fringe” doctors have argued that the spike proteins produced by the COVID-19 vaccines may result in numerous deaths this winter season.

Then in November the New England Journal of Medicine suggested a similar situation. The spike proteins produced by the COVID-19 vaccines may lead to myocarditis and neurological concerns.

And recently results from Germany and France show that myocarditis is on the rise this past year for some reason?

Since vaccines were widely distributed last year, myocarditis rates surged more than 75%. One might say, “Covid causes myocarditis. That’s what could account for the rise.” Except, myocarditis cases dropped at the start of the Covid pandemic (Jan 2020) and kept declining for a few months afterwards (May – Sept 2020). What happened in the middle of last year that could have resulted in a large increase in myocarditis cases? Perhaps the widespread administration of a medical intervention that causes a significant number of myocarditis cases (in specific demographics)? Maybe Germany is just an outlier and I’m senselessly speculating. Look at France:
