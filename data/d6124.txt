Footballer Benjamin Mendy has arrived at court as he continues to fight seven rape charges.

The Manchester City defender is accused of attacking five women between October 2020 and August 2021.

The 27-year-old, who also faces a sexual assault charge, denies all the allegations made against him.

He arrived at Chester Crown Court for a hearing but a full trial is not expected to go ahead until June.

Mr Mendy was seen being escorted out of a people carrier wearing a black suit with his face covered by a mask.

Earlier this month, the France international was granted bail after being held in custody for five months.

A judge ordered him to stay at his home address, not contact any complainant and to surrender his passport.

He was held at HMP Manchester after being transferred from HMP Altcourse in Liverpool.

The alleged offences include three counts of rape said to have happened on October 11 2020, sexual touching on 2 January last year, two counts of rape on July 24 and two counts of rape on August 23.

Mr Mendy has been charged alongside Louis Saha Matturie, who faces six counts of rape and one of sexual assault.

Manchester City bought the defender for a fee reportedly over Â£50m from Monaco in 2017.

He has made 75 appearances and has represented France at international level 10 times.

His club has suspended him pending the investigation.
