Feb. 1 (UPI) -- A Tennessee judge has ruled that a former death row inmate's new life sentences will be served at the same time, meaning he'll be eligible for parole in five years.

Pervis Payne was initially sentenced to death in 1988 for the slayings of Charisse Christopher, 28, and her 2-year-old daughter, Lacie Jo, in 1987 in Shelby County. Prosecutors said he also non-fatally injured Christopher's 3-year-old son, Nicholas.
