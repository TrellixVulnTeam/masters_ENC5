A North Korean state media documentary has claimed Kim Jong-un has “withered” out of concern and hard work for his people, revealing that his body has been left so weak that he struggles to walk down a set of stairs.

The documentary – 2021, A Great Victorious Year – appears to suggest Kim’s dramatic weight loss last year was linked to his sacrificial sense of duty to the population, feeding into his growing cult of personality, reported NK News, the Seoul-based website that first revealed the new footage.

While the video sticks to long-held state media traditions of showcasing Kim’s military leadership and prowess on a white steed, the focus on his stark weight loss also reflects the country’s hardships over the past year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, international sanctions and widespread food shortages.

It also coincided with the mysterious shrinking of his once hefty physique, raising concerns about his health and ability to lead.
