This year's Super Bowl will take place on Sunday, February 13, starting at 11:30pm UK time and running until around 3am. If you struggle to refrain from nipping into the kitchen to grab a packet of crisps during the ad break of an ITV drama, imagine staying up until the early hours of the morning, just before the birds begin to chirp again, without sustenance. My stomach is rumbling at the thought.

While a bag of supermarket own-brand popcorn might be enough to get you through to the halftime show, why not embrace the star-spangled spirit of things and rustle up an All-American feast of snacks, sides and sweet treats. Dunk some marinated chicken thighs lathered in hot sauce into a cool blue cheese dip, chow down on a crispy fish fillet sandwiched between two floury buns, or take a generous slice out of a warm dark chocolate pecan pie. Or, alternatively, sample the whole selection. It's a long old match, after all.
