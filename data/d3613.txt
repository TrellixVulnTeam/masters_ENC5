Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC), whose eligibility to run for reelection is being formally challenged, has now begun his legal fight against that effort, the Raleigh News & Observer reports.

“Aside from a blanket one-sentence denial, Cawthorn does not address the allegations against him — namely, that he supported and possibly even helped plan the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress by supporters of President Donald Trump attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.”

“Rather, his lawsuit says the N.C. State Board of Elections has no authority to keep him off the ballot in the first place, and so the challenge against him should be dropped and the state law allowing for such challenges should be ruled unconstitutional.”
