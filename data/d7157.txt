THE healing properties of breast milk have long been documented.

But one mum has revealed she uses her own breast milk for a huge variety of purposes, including to whiten her teeth and give her more energy.

Amba took to TikTok to reveal the multiple ways she uses her milk, beginning with answering the question: "How are your teeth so white?"

In response, she popped a toothbrush into her pumped milk, before brushing her teeth with the brush.

To answer a question about keeping her skin soft, Amba used a flannel dipped in the milk on her facade, before putting it in a spray bottle and saturating her hair with it to keep her locks healthy.

"How do you never look tired with all those kids?" another question read, with Amba patting on a bit of the milk under her eyes.

But it was the final act that proved so divisive, as she started drinking the milk to answer "how do you have so much energy?"

"i was okay till she drank it," someone commented on the video.

"I could never get myself to drink it , this makes me regret not trying it," another person added.

"You're telling me I've been walking around with these bags under my eyes for 5 years for nothing?" a third person remarked.

"I better put that milk to use!"

"No seriously! its insane how beneficial it is!" Amba replied.

Other mums said they'd been using the milk to cure their ailments for years, with one writing: "Yes girl! And all my stretch marks are GONE lol."

"Also helps with cuts, ear aches, pretty much everything!!" another added.

In other parenting news, this mum describes herself as a "trash parent" who has reused a broken water table to store her son's underwear.

This mum is 37 weeks pregnant and her bump is so big that people think she's expecting four sets of twins.

And this mum is proud of her messy car and wants other mums not to be ashamed of theirs.
