I remember reading Bob Dylan once saying that he didn’t really write his songs. They were out there, floating in the air; he just happened to be the one who grabbed them. It’s a lovely and kind of poetic thought—that “Mr. Tambourine Man” and “Like a Rolling Stone” and all the others were just objects, at once mystical and animate, suspended in the atmosphere, hovering just out of our reach, and only the Bard of Hibbing occupied the magical wavelength to reach them and pull them to the ground.

Donald Trump is Dylan’s dark, toxic antipode. If there’s a poisonous idea out there in the air, a lethal and pestilential trope at risk of being underutilized, we can be sure that Trump will grab it and inject it into the discourse. He never misses an opportunity to debase civilization.

I was watching a clip of his Saturday night rally. Specifically, his extended monologue about all the prosecutions he’s currently facing. He referred to the prosecutors as “radical, vicious, racist.” Radical and vicious didn’t faze me. That’s the kind of rhetorical offal that oozes out of the man’s mouth every time he opens it.
