Human remains discovered at a nature reserve last week have been formally identified as a missing person last seen more than five years ago.

Police officers were called to the area of woodland just before 3pm on January 24 following a report that bones had been found.

The remains, found in Horwich, Bolton, were confirmed to be human and have since been identified as James Hodgkiss, 34, who was reported missing back in 2016.

Manchester Evening News reports that James was last seen wheeling a black hand-luggage bag on the morning of August 3, 2016.

A missing person investigation was launched at the time but James could not be located.

An investigation is ongoing to establish the cause of death.

Police said there are believed to be no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and a report has been prepared for the coroner.

James’ family are being supported by specialist officers.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Rollinson, of GMP's Bolton district, said: "Our thoughts go out to James' family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.

"We would now ask that their privacy be respected as they come to terms with this news.

"At the time of James' disappearance, an extensive missing person investigation was launched, with a number of searches carried out, as well as extensive financial, CCTV, and social media enquiries undertaken.

"Sadly, this is not the news that many will have hoped for.

“However, our investigation will continue to establish the full circumstances and provide the answers his family is looking for."
