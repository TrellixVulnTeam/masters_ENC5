TAMTA – The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office has released the name of the second deputy found dead in a vacation rental home in St. Augustine, FL, on Saturday.

Deputy Abigail Bieber, who patrolled the northwest portion of Hillsborough County, was fatally shot by her boyfriend on January 29, 2022.

Deputy Bieber, who was 30 years old, had worked with the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office since February of 2018.

“As a passionate advocate for child victims, Deputy Bieber frequently and diligently responded to calls for service related to sexual battery and child abuse. She aspired to one day become a detective within the Criminal Investigations Division Special Victims Section. During her nearly four years at HCSO, Deputy Bieber had a number of remarkable encounters, including everything from taking drugs off of our streets to serving as a role model to children she met during her shifts. Known for her contagious smile, Deputy Bieber was a friend to fellow deputies and a bright spot in a dark world, as described by a squadmate. Co-workers also described Deputy Bieber as a young woman with a positive attitude who never shied away from tough investigations. She was known for being kind, genuine, caring, and empathetic with the demeanor of a veteran law enforcement officer.”
