Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Gallup's new Mood of The Nation survey released Wednesday showed that satisfaction with the state of the nation in the United States remains low after a difficult 2020 and early 2021.

Collectively, satisfaction in 2022 is "about as bad as it's been in two decades of Gallup measurement," the analytics and advisory company said in its report.
