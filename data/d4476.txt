Dillon Helbig, an 8-year-old boy from Boise, Idaho, spent his holiday break writing 81 pages of a book he wanted everyone to read. “The Adventures of Dillon Helbig’s Crismis” by the author “Dillon His Self” is a richly-illustrated tale about time travel after a star atop a Christmas tree explodes.

Without a book deal, he slipped the sole copy of his book onto a fiction shelf of a local library. Over the next month, it became one of the library’s most sought-after titles and inspired children in Boise to write their own stories. Publishers have finally come around, and the librarians are planning to make extra copies of the book.

“My next book,’’ Dillon said, “is going to be called ‘The Jacket-Eating Closet,’ based on actual events.”
