"The most important thing right now is to keep doing well and trying to develop our process and way of playing," Bento said. "We have two more games to finish this qualifying phase. We have the opportunity to conquer six more points. We have the opportunity to reach first place in the group. I think that is a goal that is good for us to try to achieve."
