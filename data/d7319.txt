It's not something most athletes competing at the Beijing Winter Olympics likely trained for: delicately navigating what they can or should say about long-standing claims over China's human rights record and other sensitive geopolitical affairs.

China's government has drawn scrutiny from Western nations and human rights groups over claims – which Beijing strenuously denies – about mass abuses against Muslim Uyghurs, Tibetans and other ethnic groups. It stands accused of dismantling Hong Kong's once-lively civil society. Chinese authorities' insistence that self-ruled Taiwan is a part of China that it will one day take control of again, by force if necessary, has complicated attempts to stabilize relations between China and the U.S. and its allies.
