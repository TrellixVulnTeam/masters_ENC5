Morgan Stanley’s Chief Investment Officer recently said a plunge of more than 20% in U.S. stocks is looking more and more like a real possibility…

But he’s got the “real villain” all wrong.Pointing toward weaker growth and falling consumer confidence as the likely culprits of the upcoming crash.

Yes, a slowing economy is a real risk to the market…

But the true cause of the next crash? The Federal Reserve.

The funny thing is, the Fed is as much a victim as it is a culprit…

I suggest you watch it as soon as you’re able…

Because I know you’ve worked hard for your money…

And I don’t want you to waste years of sacrifice just because you were blindsided by the Fed.
