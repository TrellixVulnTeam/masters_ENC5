ROY KEANE has been offered a dramatic return to management at his old club Sunderland.

The former Stadium of Light boss held talks yesterday with Black Cats owner Kyril Louis-Dreyfus.



And Keane, who quit the club 13 years ago, is now deciding whether to take up the position as successor to Lee Johnson.

Johnson was axed following the Wearsiders’ 6-0 thrashing by Bolton in League One on Saturday.

Louis-Dreyfus said they had been 'overwhelmed' with applicants.

Mick McCarthy, another ex-Sunderland manager, and Neil Warnock have thrown their hat in the ring, with Grant McCann, Neil Lennon and Alex Neil also on the radar.

Keane, 50, who took the Black Cats to the 2007 Championship title, has not managed since being sacked by Ipswich in 2011.

But it is thought the fiery Irishman can reignite third-placed Sunderland’s promotion hopes.

Keane is a Sky pundit after coaching with the Republic of Ireland, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest.

The Black Cats were Keane’s first hotseat but the Manchester United icon left under a cloud and later said: “It still saddens me.

"I still think I should be Sunderland manager.”

Mike Dodds will take charge against Doncaster on Saturday, where Jermain Defoe is expected to make his second debut.
