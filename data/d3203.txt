Over the years I have found unusually reliable sources for breaking news and information – and sometimes been a source of it myself.

I did like sharing some of this information on Facebook. I always knew, given the experiences that my friend Craig Kelly had with Facebook, that I risked being de-platformed there at any time. This happened on Sunday night. Apparently just for 24 hours. And with warnings I risked more if I didn’t comply with their community standards.

I still have this blog and website. Rather than just add major articles irregularly, I’m going to trial adding stories that interest me as a thread here that grows over that month – over each month. Snippets that I might have once shared on Facebook.

The famous and popular from Neil Young to Prince Harry have attempted to have Joe Rogan removed from Spotify. Thankfully the platform has stood firm, and he is still there.

In an impromptu response to ‘the haters’ Rogan has commented:

The problem I have with the term disinformation, especially today, is that 8 months ago, many of the things that were considered ‘disinformation’ are now accepted as fact. For example, 8 months ago, if you said, if you get vaccinated you can still catch COVID and you can still spread COVID, you would be removed from social media, they would ban you from certain platforms.

The feature image is a photograph from my drone of the remnants of a wave breaking at Granite Bay in Noosa National Park. It looks to me like lace. I am inspired everyday by nature and by people.
