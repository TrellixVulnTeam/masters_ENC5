He’s a dude (in the truest sense) without a medical or traditional journalistic background combing through the same conspiratorial information your friends and relatives are, and inviting some fringe figures on to talk about it for hours at a time. (Rogan said this week that he intends to do better research and conceded, “I don’t always get it right.”)
