So, you want to be Andy Murray? Don’t we all! Here we have our favourite flying Scotsman’s official kit for the Australian Open 2022. Placed at the higher end of the price point spectrum, it has all things you would hope for in the decision making process to part with your well-earned cash.

We love the simple, clean diagonal cross hatch graphic across the chest, which perhaps is more at home on centre court than posing around town - some may say it has a tartan edge to it.

As soon as you start moving around, it feels glove like (not too tight either) and the fabric has supreme flexibility. It’s a very lightweight affair with outstanding breathability. This jacket from the AMC arm of Castore has two ‘kangaroo’-style open front pockets.

The overall sleek quality finish gives you unrivalled comfort as well as performance. It excelled from baseline to net sitting and moving perfectly, whilst executing all the shots in the book.

Admittedly, we found the zip a little stiff when fastening/unfastening, but that should ease over the breaking in period.

We could have happily played ball for an extra tie-break or two and didn’t really want to take it off. What else would you expect from the former British number 1 with a knighthood, 3 Grand Slam titles and a double Olympic champion to his name?
