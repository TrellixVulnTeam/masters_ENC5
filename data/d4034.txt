Slashing the living standards of families who are already feeling the squeeze could trigger a ferocious backlash against the Conservatives and Boris Johnson.

Households simply cannot lose nearly £2,000 in spending power without feeling intense pain or plunging into debt.

The Cabinet Ministers increasing taxes on incomes through National Insurance or failing to cool rising prices – particularly soaring fuel bills – are a major part of the problem.

One of the fundamental dividing lines in politics is whose side a party is on. Opinion polls suggest voters are recognising the Conservatives are tightening family budgets callously whereas Labour is proposing fully-costed policies to put extra money into pay packets and slow price hikes.

Working people deserve better from a government and political party which only pretends it is on their side, levelling down their living standards while falsely claiming to want to level up those it disadvantaged for years.

We are learning how the Conservatives cannot be trusted with taxpayers’ money as they admitted to £8.7billion losses on Covid PPE contracts worth £12.1bn.

Every piece of unusable, unsuitable and overpriced item is charged to the British public and the colossal waste of our money by the Government is indefensible.

Add other unacceptable bills such as the £4.3bn in loans and financial support written off as Covid fraud and the total tops £12bn before other areas are counted – enough to cancel a year’s National Insurance rises or suspend BBC licence fees for nearly four years.

Russian mockery of Boris Johnson’s visit to Ukraine would normally be dismissed as Putin propaganda.

Yet the truth for Britain is that our Prime Minister is an international joke and our country is further diminished every day that the lying charlatan survives in Downing Street.
