Holly Willoughby has given a little insight into her time away as her absence on This Morning continues.

Those tuning into the ITV daytime show on Monday were confused after thinking the 40-year-old presenter would return.

Instead, Rochelle Humes was back alongside Phillip Schofield - despite fans thinking her 'last day' was last Thursday.

While she has still been appearing on Dancing On Ice with her co-host, Holly is actually spending the rest of the week away filming a new show.

The mum-of-three, 40, will join Lee Mack as host of an entertainment reality show inspired by the teachings of Dutch extreme athlete Wim Hof.

Wim Hof's Superstar Survival on BBC One will see a group of celebrities embark on an "epic adventure of self-improvement, and face a unique test of mental strength like no other".

Taking to Instagram on Monday, Holly shared a glimpse into her life currently away from home.

"Favourite furry FaceTime," she shared alongside a snap to her millions of followers.

It showed her sweet pup Bailey on the other end of the phone as a fresh-faced Holly chilled out as she filmed the new show in Europe.

But the comments were filled with the same comment.

@amandaroberts2323 said: "Awww he's so cute. Holly when are u back on This Morning miss u."

"Miss you on this morning!!" fan page @hollywillsuk wrote.

@pskey1 commented: "Please come back. Miss you in the mornings."

"Missing you on This Morning," @elle_1.1478549 echoed.

While Holly's return date hasn't been confirmed, Rochelle said she'd be hosting for a 'few weeks' which could mean she'll be back on Monday or any day now.

If Holly does return this week, Holly will be without co-host Phillip Schofield.

The TV star, 59, shared on Monday that he had tested positive for coronavirus.
