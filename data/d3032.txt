Microbial keratitis is the main cause of corneal opacification and the fourth leading cause of blindness worldwide, with bacteria the major infectious agent. Recently, bacterial keratitis has become a serious threat due to routine use of antibiotics leading to selection of resistant and multidrug-resistant bacteria strains. New approaches for treatment of bacterial keratitis are necessary to outcome the increasing antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy is based on three agents: photosensitizer, oxygen, and light radiation. This therapy has been successful for treatment of infections in different tissues and organs as well as against different type of infectious agents and no resistance development. Also, new photosensitizers are being developed that has increased the spectrum of therapeutic protocols for treatment of a number of infectious diseases. Thus, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy has an extraordinary potential for treatment of those bacterial keratitis cases that actually are not solved by traditional antibiotic therapy.
