TWO new species of killer hammerhead flatworms are heading to our gardens, scientists have warned.

Some have already been found in Europe and experts believe it is only a matter of time before they cross the Channel in imported pot plants.

Measuring just 3cm long, they hunt down and feast on earthworms, slugs and snails.

Their arrival could threaten the natural biodiversity of ­British gardens and could even harm crop yields in the countryside, according to scientists.

More than ten species of flatworm are known to have spread around the world from Asia, thanks to the plant trade.

One of the new varieties was found in France and Italy, the other on an island near Africa.

Some of the world’s biggest types grow up to 3ft long.

Experts from Paris’s National History Museum warned of the new varieties after looking at the latest data during lockdown.

Professor Jean-Lou Justine said: “These species have the potential to become invasive and spread all over the world.”

Enrico Ruzzier, who collected samples, added: “As soon as the sun started heating up the surface, you could see thousands of flatworms coming out.”
