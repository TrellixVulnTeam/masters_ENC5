THE 2022 Super Bowl game is right around the corner which means it's almost time for brand new commercials.

On February 2, 2022, Uber Eats released a snippet of its new Super Bowl commercial, revealing a star-studded cast.

Who stars in the Uber Eats commercial?

Uber Eats has become one of the most popular food delivery services in the United States.

In its upcoming ad campaign, the company hired Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Coolidge, and Trevor Noah to sink their teeth into all the treats Uber Eats has to offer.

Coolidge, 60, is seen inspecting purple lipstick, looking confused as to why it's in her delivery bag.

Noah, 37, also has a puzzled look as he pulls out and starts eating a tube of deodorant.

Paltrow, 49, then follows suit and pulls out one of her infamous "This Smells Like My Vagina" candles and takes a bite.

"This candle tastes funny," she says in the teaser clip. "Not bad, but funny."

The full commercial is scheduled to air live during the Super Bowl LVI.

When is the 2022 Super Bowl?

The 2022 Super Bowl game is scheduled to be held at California's SoFi stadium and feature a match-up of the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals.

The 2022 event will take place on Sunday, February 13, 2022.

Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, and Kendrick Lamar are all scheduled to perform during the half-time show.

How much do commercial spots cost?

The Super Bowl is one of America's most-watched televised sporting events, which makes it a prime-time event for television commercials.

Back in June 2021, Variety reported that ad space is around $6million per 30-seconds.

Executives familiar with current negotiations told the media outlet that potential sponsors may also have to buy an equal amount of ad space during NBC's 2022 broadcast of the Beijing Winter Olympics - that is if they want to score prominent placement.

Back in the 1970s, the cost of a Super Bowl commercial was $78,200, according to Vogue.
