Feb. 1 (UPI) -- A day after the United States and Russia clashed over Ukraine at the United Nations Security Council, the countries' top two diplomats were scheduled to speak by phone on Tuesday to address escalating fears about Moscow ordering a military invasion.

Officials said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will speak, with a goal of heading off further military escalation near Russia's border with Ukraine.
