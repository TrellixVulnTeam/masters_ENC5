“Private jets, cool cars, amazing parties all over the world. What happened to me felt like a movie. But in the movies, there’s always bad guys.” Step forward, eponymous bad guy The Tinder Swindler. What duly unfolds in this one-off Netflix documentary is a juicy, jaw-dropping true-crime story which beggars belief.

The stranger-than-fiction caper begins with 29-year-old IT consultant Cecilie Fjellhoy – a sweet Norwegian woman based in London – swiping at her smartphone as she looks for love. She’s something of a “Tinder expert” but even this experienced online dater was excited when she matched with billionaire businessman Simon Leviev.

He claims to be the son of a Russian diamond magnate and heir to the family business. A popular playboy with 103,000 social media followers, the self-styled “prince of diamonds” swiftly messages Cecilie. They meet, click and she’s soon swept along by his high-lux lifestyle.

After months of dating, much of it long-distance, disaster strikes. A business feud turns nasty, resulting in death threats and an assassination attempt on Leviev. He can’t use his own platinum American Express card because it’s a security risk, so can he borrow Cecilie’s? Oh, and could she bring $25,000 in cash too?

Leviev claims he is on the run from his enemies, so keeps requesting money for flights (first class, naturally) and other expenses. Before Cecilie realises, she’s been parted from $250,000 she doesn’t have. When AmEx agents knock on her door, the truth emerges. “That’s the guy,” say investigators when she shows them a photo. “He does this for a living.” “How could he be so evil?” sobs the devastated Cecilie. “The man I loved was never real. Everything was a lie.” Heartbroken and drowning in debt, she contemplates suicide.
