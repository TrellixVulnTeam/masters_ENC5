A statement from Greater Manchester Police on Tuesday confirmed his arrest on suspicion of the further offences.

It added that questioning was ongoing after magistrates granted an extension to keep the player in custody until Wednesday.

The statement said: "Detectives have been granted further additional time to speak to a man in his 20s who was arrested on suspicion of rape and assault of a woman.

"The suspect was detained in custody on Sunday afternoon after we became aware of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence.

"He continues to be questioned after magistrates authorised an extension until tomorrow.

"Following enquiries so far, he has since been further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and threats to kill."
