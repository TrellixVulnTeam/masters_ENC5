Feb. 2 (UPI) -- More than 1.2 million people will die from drug overdoses across North America by the end of the decade unless governments institute public health policies that treat drug addiction as a chronic condition and prioritize prevention, a report published Wednesday by the Lancet found.

Opioid overdose deaths are also expected to increase worldwide as the epidemic expands beyond this continent, the report authors said.
