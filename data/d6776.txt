In an email to students, faculty and staff, Bridgewater College President David Bushman identified the victims as police officer John Painter and safety officer J.J. Jefferson.

“These officers were close friends, known to many of us as the ‘dynamic duo,'” Bushman said. “John was J.J.’s best man in his wedding this year. They were beloved by students, faculty and staff. I hurt for their families and loved ones, as I know we all do.”

“This is a sad and dark day for Bridgewater College,” he added.

A shelter in place was issued at the school, about 140 miles west of Washington, D.C., at 1:20 p.m. after “two officers had been shot and the armed suspect had fled the scene,” Bridgewater College spokesperson Logan C. Bogert said earlier. The school was given the all-clear about three hours later.
