Manchester United's decision to keep Jesse Lingard could have a detrimental effect on their pursuit of Declan Rice, according to reports.

Deadline Day was dominated by outgoings at Old Trafford as opposed to incomings, with Donny van de Beek being the highest-profile player to leave on loan.

Lingard was on the verge of a move away from Manchester but saw his move blocked prior to the news that Newcastle United were said to be ramping up their interest in the 29-year-old.

The Reds' midfield department is a position that is will be the summer priority with the England international among the list of potential additions.

However, Football.London report United's refusal to let Lingard move to East London, due to their competition as direct rivals for a place in the Champions League, could give other clubs the upper hand.

Namely, Chelsea, whose quiet January seemingly points towards a busy summer for Thomas Tuchel's side with Rice as well as Sevilla defender Jules Kounde among the targets.

The Reds earmarked Rice as their principal target in September and with a new manager incoming, they too look set for a busy summer.

Meanwhile, United's rivals Leeds reportedly turned down the opportunity to sign Van de Beek last month.

The Dutchman's torrid time at Old Trafford came to a temporary end on deadline day after he secured a move to Goodison Park and became Frank Lampard's first signing as manager.

And the Yorkshire Evening Post have reported that Marcelo Bielsa turned down the possibility to sign the 24-year-old after he was offered his services as their efforts to sign Brenden Aaronson failed.
