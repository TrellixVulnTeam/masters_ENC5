Spotify announced yesterday that it plans to add content advisories "to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about COVID-19," which will redirect listeners to its COVID-19 resource page . Joe posted his response on social media later in the evening, saying he will "do [his] best to make sure [he's] researched" topics pertaining to COVID before talking about them on, and he'll "try harder to get people with differing opinions" to appear on the show.
