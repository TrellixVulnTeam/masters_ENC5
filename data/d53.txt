Rihanna is pregnant, it has been revealed, after months of speculation as to whether she was expecting or not.

The superstar singer, 33, showed off her baby bump during a walk-about in New York City with her boyfriend, rapper A$AP Rocky last week.

Amazing photos show her making absolutely no effort to hide her bump, with her pink puffer jacket actually unbuttoned to show it off on a snowy day in the city. Rihanna and A$AP are believe to have been together since late 2020 but have known each other since the early 2010s when they regularly performed together.

Fans speculated she was pregnant in November of last year after she reportedly asked staff not to smoke around her when she attended Barbados’ first-ever presidential inauguration. Some also claimed they had seen a baby bump.

But she shut down rumours the following month, when a fan tweeted her: “Can I come to the baby shower sis!? True or not your babies are going to be beautiful. Sorry everyone’s up in your uterus right now.”

She responded: “Ha! Stop! You ain’t came to the first 10 baby showers! Y’all breed me every year dammit lol.”
