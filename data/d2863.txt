A Chinese manufacturer produced the 10,800 tea cups, mugs and plates to mark the Queen’s 70 year reign, but failed to notice the spelling error in the word Jubilee during production.

Wholesale Clearance UK, which sells unwanted stock in bulk, stepped in and picked up the collection, which features a painted image of the Queen and the words “To commemorate the Platinum Jubbly of Queen Elizabeth II”.

The Wholesale Clearance website says: “You will notice this is probably more at home on the shelf next to Peckham Spring as these are in fact celebrating the Queen’s Platinum Jubbly.

“These are…as you say…the Creme de la Menthe! So if you are a fan of the Queen and Del Boy…two birds with one stone.”

Only Fools And Horses character Del Boy, from the classic BBC sitcom, is known for his “Lovely jubbly” catchphrase and his dodgy money-making schemes.

Andy White of Wholesale Clearance, based in Poole Dorset, told the PA news agency: “It’s a bit of fun.

“I think the online trader rejected the items pretty much straightaway, but in hindsight, with the exposure it’s getting, they’re probably wishing they didn’t.

“Their loss will be someone else’s gain.”

The firm suggested uses for the souvenirs include: “Wowing your friends with your Lovely Jubbly set”, having a plate-smashing contest, taking up plate spinning as a hobby and having “a dangerous game of Frisbee”.

The website added: “If you close your eyes, you can almost hear those immortal words from Britain’s favourite businessman ringing through the halls of Nelson Mandela House.

“But in typical Only Fools manner, this isn’t exactly as expected.”

The stock is for sale as a bulk lot for £32,400, and Wholesale Clearance suggests any buyer could make a potential profit of more than £291,492.
