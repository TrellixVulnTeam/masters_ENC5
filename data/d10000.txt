Emmanuel Macron’s rivals for the French presidency have accused him of abusing electoral rules by delaying his candidacy, as one statistical study on Wednesday put his chances of re-election at 79 per cent.

Mr Macron last month said there was “no false suspense” over his intention to run for re-election.

But he has made it clear he plans to wait “until the final quarter of an hour” before officially declaring he will seek a second term in the April elections, with Ukraine and coronavirus still high on the agenda.

Speaking to regional newspaper La Voix du Nord on Tuesday night, he said that along with tackling the Covid crisis: “I can’t reasonably explain to the French that I’m going to throw myself into this important democratic moment when I’ve told them I would be president until the end and when we have a crisis on the Ukraine border that is threatening our collective security.”

He had spoken to Vladimir Putin “three times on the telephone” and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky twice in recent days, he added. Mr Macron may travel to Germany for talks later this week.

The 44-year-old centrist’s rivals have accused him of unfairly delaying the announcement to take advantage of his presidential status to defend his record without being seen as a candidate.

While their airtime has been counted since January 1, his only is when he announces future investments that would require a second term.

They have also criticised his decision not to put off to a later date France’s six-month stint as rotating president of the European Union, which began on January.
