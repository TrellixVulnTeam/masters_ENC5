The survey found at least 75 per cent of ethnic minority doctors experienced racism more than once in the past two years and 17.4 per cent experienced regular racism at work.

Speaking to the BBC BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: “This is about a moral right for anyone who works for the NHS to be treated fairly.”

The NHS’s medical director of primary care, Dr Nikki Kanani, responded by telling the broadcaster that racism and discrimination of any kind “should not be tolerated by anyone”.

“While our latest equality report [in 2020] shows that we have made progress in some areas of the NHS, it is completely unacceptable for anyone to experience racism, discrimination or prejudice at work, and NHS organisations should continue to take a zero-tolerance approach to all and any form of discrimination,” she said.

The survey provided to the BBC of more than 2,000 people found around 40 per cent of NHS doctors are from minority backgrounds.

More than 70 per cent of those who had faced racism at work did not complain about it.

Almost 20 per cent said they considered leaving their job or had left their job in the past two years because of racism.

Nearly 60 per cent said racism at work had impacted their mental health and wellbeing, and 20 per cent said they experienced racism from patients.
