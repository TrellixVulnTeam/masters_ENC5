Former President Donald Trump endorsed South Carolina state Rep. Russell Fry (R) in his Republican primary challenge to unseat Rep. Tom Rice (R-SC), who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol, the Charleston Post and Courier reports.

Trump called Rice, who is seeking a sixth term, “the coward who abandoned his constituents by caving to Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left.”
