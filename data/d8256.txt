Reo Hatate bagged a stunning first-half brace to write himself into Old Firm folklore, first catching Allan McGregor out with a clever volley after a rapid-fire start from the hosts before a wonderful strike halfway through the opening forty-five.

Were if not for McGregor, who had a point to prove following a poor performance in the draw against Ross County over the weekend, Celtic could well have gone into the break by a larger scoreline. The veteran â€˜keeper twice saved well from Giorgos Giakoumakis as the hosts constantly tore through their bitter rivals with a blur of quick passing.

When Liel Abade nipped in to add a third before the interval after some lax Rangers defending, Celtic Park erupted.

From there, Rangers did improve - particularly after bringing Fashion Sakala on for Amad Diallo and replacing Glen Kamara with Ryan Jack - but did little to truly trouble Joe Hart in the Celtic goal.

This was the first time Celtic had beaten Rangers in two years and, in many ways, felt like a sign of changing times. Clearly, nothing is won yet but this Rangers side looked almost as stale as their bitter rivals did last season.

The Scottish Premiership title race is truly on.
