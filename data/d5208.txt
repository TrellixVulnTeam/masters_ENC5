On the final day, South Korea played Uzbekistan to a scoreless draw, while Syria had a 2-2 draw with Iran thanks to an equalizer during second-half injury time. If Syria had somehow upset Iran, they would have earned the ticket to Russia for the World Cup, while South Korea would have been relegated to a two-legged playoff against the third seed from Group B. South Korea finished with four wins, two draws and two losses.
