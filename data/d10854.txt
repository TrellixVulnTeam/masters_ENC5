The Gilder Fellows Seminar is an intimate study experience with Discovery Institute Fellows in Seattle, Washington, in July 2022. At the Gilder Fellows Seminar, you’ll have the chance to interact with scholars George Gilder, Jay Richards, Gale Pooley, John West, and other luminaries.

If you or someone you know would benefit from a better understanding of the intersection of free markets and technology, the ongoing debate about capitalism vs. socialism, how to compassionately care for the homeless or those in poverty, or the best ways to defeat the nihilistic ideology of scarcity, you won’t want to miss your chance to learn directly from these renowned experts.

Through guided lecturers and readings, participants will explore questions such as these:
• Is free enterprise still the best system for human flourishing?
• How do we cultivate the “spirit of enterprise”?
• What do cultures need to alleviate poverty and create wealth?
• How should we respond to the resurgence of interest in socialism?
• How does capitalism relate to the Judeo-Christian tradition?
• What are the promises and perils of future technology?
• How do we prepare for a future of smart machines and artificial intelligence?
• What is the future of cryptocurrencies?
