Of those hospitalized, 669 are in intensive care, a drop of 238 ICU patients from a week ago, Illinois Department of Public Health records show.

IDPH officials also reported 123 more COVID-19 deaths, along with 8,665 new infections.

That brings the state's death toll from the virus to 31,036, while 2,929,636 cases have been diagnosed statewide since the outset of the pandemic nearly two years ago.

The state's seven-day case positivity rate is at 6.8%, down from 7.2% Monday. Case positivity is the percentage of test results that yield a new case of the disease. A seven-day average is used to account for anomalies in the daily reporting of the figures.
