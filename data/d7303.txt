SEOUL, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that North Korea violated its self-imposed moratorium on long-range missile launches when it fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. territory of Guam this weekend.

Guterres condemned the test, saying it was "a breaking of the DPRK's announced moratorium in 2018 on launches of this nature, and a clear violation of Security Council resolutions," according to a statement by his spokesman released on Tuesday.
