FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky's local school boards would be required to set aside at least 15 minutes for public comments during regular meetings under a bill passed by the state House on Wednesday.

The bill seeks to ensure that school board members hear feedback from parents and other residents, said Republican Rep. Regina Huff, the bill’s lead sponsor. Many school boards already welcome public comments, but the bill is aimed at some districts that “closed the door” to such input, she said.

The measure cleared the House on a 66-24 vote and now goes to the Senate.

Democratic Rep. Lisa Willner said it’s important for elected boards to hear from constituents but said some school board meetings nationwide have been marred by disruptions. School board meetings have become increasingly contentious, stemming in part from a backlash against mask mandates and lessons about racism in U.S. history.

Willner offered an amendment to allow boards to pass over public comment periods because of security concerns. Huff responded that school boards should take steps to ensure security but said the amendment would provide “another loophole” to silence people. The amendment was defeated.

“I think the opportunity to speak without being locked out would go a long way in making a more peaceful situation," Huff said during the debate.

The bill would allow school boards to bypass public comment periods if no one signs up to speak.
