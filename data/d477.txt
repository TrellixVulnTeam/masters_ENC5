“To be clear, this decision is based solely upon an assessment of the law and whether the People can establish a legally sufficient case under controlling precedent,” Oakes said in a statement.

“In no way should this decision be interpreted as casting doubt upon the character or credibility of Ms. Limmiatis, or how harmful the acts she experienced were.”

Oakes said the woman was found to be “reliable and reasonable, seemingly motivated only by an earnest desire to do the right thing.”

Oakes criticized current state law that makes it difficult for him to pursue a criminal case.

Mariann Wang, an attorney for Limmiatis, praised Oakes’ work and stressed that although the case “is not being criminally prosecuted [it] does not mean Cuomo is ‘innocent.’ His behavior towards her in May 2017 was a plain abuse of power.”

Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi released photos of the interaction and claimed there was no inappropriate touching. He added that five district attorneys have now concluded no criminal conduct was committed by the governor as detailed in the report from Attorney General Tish James.

“This has always been a political hit job to further the Attorney General’s own ambitions, which both reeks of prosecutorial misconduct and has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars. As we’ve said since the beginning, the truth will come out,” Azzopardi said in a statement.

The Attorney General's Office refuted Azzopardi's claims, saying it was Cuomo who asked for the investigation into his conduct amid political pressure.

"The findings of this independent investigation have been corroborated by a mountain of evidence, the Assembly’s report, and multiple District Attorneys, including the Oswego DA today, who have said that these women and their allegations of sexual harassment by the former governor are ‘credible,'" the office said.

"Mr. Cuomo’s relentless attacks on these brave women will not mask the truth — he is a serial sexual harasser.”
