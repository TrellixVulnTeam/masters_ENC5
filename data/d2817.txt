(OPINION) The recently aired episode of “Dr. Phil” featuring conservative commentator Matt Walsh confronting left-leaning “gender experts” in what was dubbed a “pronoun debate” has seemingly been removed from the streaming platform Hulu.

According to The Daily Wire, some Hulu users noticed this week that episode 83 of season 20 — the one featuring Walsh — is no longer listed on the platform.

It initially aired Jan. 19. Additionally, Faithwire noticed an extended YouTube clip teasing the episode has been removed from public view and is now “unlisted,” meaning it can only be accessed by those who have the direct web link to the video. It is embedded below:

Despite the apparent attempt to suppress the content, the video has still amassed more than one million views on YouTube alone. Last week, Walsh tweeted about the apparent disappearance: “I have heard from a lot of people that my episode of ‘Dr. Phil’ is mysteriously missing from Hulu even though literally every other episode is available.” I have heard from a lot of people that my episode of Dr Phil is mysteriously missing from Hulu even though literally every other episode is available https://t.co/19kEMkKt62 It’s worth noting that Hulu’s support account did respond to one Twitter user who asked the streaming service to explain why the episode featuring Walsh was nowhere to be found. “Episodes of ‘Dr. Phil’ are available to Hulu + Live TV subscribers via CBS On-demand at the discretion of the network,” Hulu’s support account tweeted. “We don’t determine availability for network on-demand episodes on our end. We hope that helps clarify!”
