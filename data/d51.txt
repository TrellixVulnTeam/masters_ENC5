CARA Delevingne says she is kitting out a designer wardrobe for her future children – despite having no intention of falling pregnant anytime soon.

The supermodel admitted she was “manifesting” a baby and that she couldn’t resist forking out on clobber.

Cara, 29, is already an aunt to her older sister Chloe’s two sons, Atticus and Juno.

Speaking about wanting kids, Cara said: “I want to have babies. But not yet.

“I buy children’s clothes for my future child who doesn’t exist.

“Baby shoes really get me – they break my heart. I went shopping the other day and I bought these tiny Air Jordans, which are purple and they have a lion on them.

During the interview with the March edition of Harper’s Bazaar UK Cara also opened up about the lack of LGBT role models she had growing up.

The model identifies as pan-sexual, whereby she is not influenced by sex, gender or gender identity when choosing a partner.

Cara said: “I do think I would have hated myself less, I would have not been so ashamed, if I’d had someone.

“The one thing I’m happy about growing up queer and fighting it and hiding it is it gives me so much fire and drive to try to make people’s lives easier in some way by talking about it.”

Her struggle led to mental health issues and Cara went on to quit school.

She continued: “I dropped out, and I really just wanted to be able to prove that I wasn’t the deadbeat I thought I was.

“When you have mental health struggles, you can’t see anything, it blinds you.”

Cara first told fans she was sexually fluid in 2018 before she revealed she was pan-sexual two years later.

Cara said at the time: “The thing is with me, I change a lot.

“I feel different all the time. Some days, I feel more womanly. Some days, I feel more like a man.

“I always will remain, I think, pansexual.

“However one defines themselves, whether it’s ‘they’ or ‘he’ or ‘she,’ I fall in love with the person — and that’s that.
