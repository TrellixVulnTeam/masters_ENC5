STEVE BRUCE is due to be named West Brom’s new manager within days.

Bruce, 61, was axed by Newcastle in October in the wake of Toon’s Saudi-led takeover.

But he is the red-hot favourite to take over at The Hawthorns after Albion sacked Valerien Ismael yesterday just seven months into a four-year deal.

Bruce has been in talks with the Baggies and should be in charge for the first time on Wednesday at Sheffield United.

The search for the West Brom's new manager is being led by ex-Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay who has taken on the same role at Albion.

Gourlay’s appointment was announced moments after news of Ismael’s exit in a behind the scenes shake-up.

But it soon became clear Bruce is the man being lined up to replace Ismael as the club’s sixth boss is under three years.

His first job is to halt the club’s slide and revive their promotion challenge.

Bruce boasts a superb Championship record having led Birmingham and Hull into the top flight two times apiece.

Baggies fans turned on Ismael, 46, following a poor run of results which saw his team fall away from the top two spots.

Albion are fifth with just three wins in 14 games and Saturday’s 2-0 loss at Millwall was the last straw.
