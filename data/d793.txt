A dedicated WhatsApp app on an iPad is something users have wanted for many years.

And it looks like the world’s most popular messaging app might finally be about to deliver.

Will Cathcart, the CEO of WhatsApp, hinted to tech site The Verge that an iPad version is on the way.

‘People have wanted an iPad app for a long time,’ he said.

Amazingly, WhatsApp first launched 13 years ago – just a year before Apple revealed the first iPad to the world.

The reason it’s taken this long to get a proper WhatsApp app for iPad is due to the way the messaging service handles encryption.

At present, only one device (your phone) holds the key to encrypt and decrypt messages on your account. WhatsApp is trying to add multi-device support, but making it all work seamlessly is tricky.

But it sounds like the company – which is owned by Facebook’s parent company Meta – has just about got there.

‘We did a lot of work on the technology for supporting multiple devices,’ Cathcart said.

‘Our web and our desktop apps now have that. If I have multi-device on, I can turn my phone off work lose my network connection and still get messages on my desktop.

‘That would be really important for a tablet app, to be able to use the app even if your phone isn’t on.

Unfortuantely, it seems we’ll still have to wait a bit longer.

But thankfully, there is a bit of a workaround you can employ to get WhatsApp on an iPad today.

How to get WhatsApp on an iPad

Unfortunately, you will need to have a smartphone to use WhatsApp on an iPad because the two need to be linked and share the same account. If you have an old smartphone lying around, now may be the time to fish it out and use it as the main device for the account. You’ll need an active SIM card in there as well.

Once you’ve got that, the good news is you can get WhatsApp on an iPad, the bad news is that it’s a bit trickier than just installing directly from the App Store. As an aside here – beware the lookalike apps that crop up when you try to search the App Store for WhatsApp on iPad, they’re not the real deal.

Here are the steps you need to follow to get WhatsApp on an iPad:
• You’ll be directed to the WhatsApp homepage since you’re visiting on a mobile browser.
• To switch to the desktop version hold the refresh button and click Request Desktop Site. You should see a QR code.
• When you open WhatsApp on your phone, go to settings and then WhatsApp Web, and scan the QR code that’s on your iPad screen.
• Then, you’re good to go.
