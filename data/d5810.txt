Auto Trader shares hit the road to recovery today as another broker upgrade heightened interest in its potential as a long-term tech winner.

Shares rose 4% to 702.3p in the FTSE 100 index after Jefferies upped its price target to 870p and backed the classifieds business as a strong play on the theme of online car retailing.

Counterparts at Liberum took a similar view yesterday after raising their estimate to 825p, pointing out that the emergence of digital players Cazoo and Cinch has fundamentally shifted how consumers purchase cars.

Auto Trader was one of a number of tech and growth-focused stocks to see a resurgence in fortunes as investors regained their risk appetite following January's volatility.

The resilient mood was helped last night by Google parent company Alphabet reporting better-than-expected fourth quarter results. The Google search and YouTube ads division lifted revenues 32% and there was a growing contribution from cloud operations.

AJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould said: “The technology sector started 2022 with some of the biggest question marks over it since the dotcom crash more than two decades ago.

“However the largest and highest quality US tech names continue to deliver the answers the market wants with big earnings beats.”

Other top flight tech stocks doing well today included industrial software business Aveva, while financial services business Abrdn lifted 6.9p to 247.5p after analysts at HSBC unveiled a “buy” recommendation and 330p target price.

The FTSE 100 index returned to near a two-year high after climbing 56.39 points to 7592.46, with the domestic-focused FTSE 250 index up 211.45 points at 22,378.21 after cyber security firm Darktrace rallied 18.6p to 408p.

Molten Ventures, whose investments include Cazoo and banking app Revolut, also surged 5% as it stuck by guidance for valuation growth of 35% in the year to March.

Chief executive Martin Davis said: “The European technology venture market continues to thrive despite the wider fluctuations in public markets. Molten is well-positioned to take advantage of this disconnect.”

Shares in the FTSE 250-listed company, which used to be known as Draper Esprit, rose 41p to 825p but still trades at a discount to November's net asset value of 887p.
