Please join us in offering condolences and empathy and sympathy and a primal scream to Tim and Cheri Welsh, whose son Tanner died yesterday. Tim honored Tanner through hundreds of thousands of social media engagements. He was relentless in telling his son's story - so many of our kids' stories. Tanner's last sentence before he stopped speaking was, "My name is Tanner." Remember him. His name was Tanner. We are so sorry, Tim and Cheri.
