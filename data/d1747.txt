VIEWERS of Jeremy Vine's show have called out a baffling Lord Sugar blunder.

Monday's episode of the Channel 5 show saw Jeremy discussing potential contenders who could go up against Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a leadership battle.

As he stood in front of a large screen, Jeremy said: "Let’s throw some names around here… now let’s go a bit wilder – Deborah Meaden, Martin Lewis the money saving expert.

"Or what about Alan Sugar himself. Could he do it? He’s a Conservative supporter."

Pictures of the people he named appeared on the screen behind him, however, the photo next to Lord Sugar's name was actually of Carry On star Sid James.

The comedy legend died in 1976 aged 62, but if Jeremy noticed that production had used a picture of the wrong person, he didn't let on to viewers and carried on with his discussion like a true pro.

While Jeremy may not have noticed, viewers certainly did, with one writing on Twitter: "They were such a carry on though. They do look similar. My sympathy is with Sid James."

Another joked: "Confusing Sid James with Alan Sugar is a right Carry on."

A third added: "I know I was half asleep but did JV put up a picture of Sid James for Sir Alan Sugar this morning !!!"

Meanwhile, Jeremy's co-presenter Storm Huntley announced she was pregnant live on air yesterday.

Storm, 34, revealed she was expecting her first baby with husband, Kerr Okan.

Storm spoke about her pregnancy after Jeremy noticed her tweet a photo of herself with Kerr looking into an oven with a loaf of bread, and captioning it, "something's cooking."

"I am having a baby," Storm confirmed, before adding she was 15 weeks along.

Storm then stood up to show off her growing baby bump, admitting her belly "could be from a carby meal, we're not sure."
