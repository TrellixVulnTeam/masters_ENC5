The downsizer market has emerged as a distinct anomaly during the post-pandemic house price boom.

Anyone wanting to sell a family home and move to somewhere smaller has a huge advantage in the market right now. While the values of family properties have surged by more than 10pc this year, agents report that prices of some retirement flats have fallen by 20pc.

The shift to home working and home schooling brought a rush of families desperate to move to larger properties in the wake of lockdown. But it also meant that older homeowners became much less keen to move to smaller properties.

But those who are currently in the market will be able to sell family homes at a record price and have more negotiating power on their onward purchase.

So where should you move to? Savills estate agents has devised a metric for house hunters looking for later life homes. It analysed English local authorities in the top half of the deprivation index, which ranks areas by factors such as life expectancy.

Within this, Savills then mapped areas according to further factors including the number of healthcare facilities per 10,000 residents, the travel times to hospitals, food shops and town centres by public transport or walking, and proximity of national parks or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
