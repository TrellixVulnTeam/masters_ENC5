The NHS is “riddled with racism”, the chair of the British Medical Association has claimed, after the council released a report finding 75 per cent of ethnic minority doctors have experienced some form of racism at work in the past two years.

The BMA’s survey found that 17.4 per cent of minority doctors also experience “regular” racism while working in the NHS.

"This is about a moral right for anyone who works for the NHS to be treated fairly," Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the BMA, told the BBC.

In response, the NHS’s medical director of primary care Dr Nikki Kanani said discrimination of any kind "should not be tolerated by anyone".

"While our latest equality report [in 2020] shows that we have made progress in some areas of the NHS, it is completely unacceptable for anyone to experience racism, discrimination or prejudice at work, and NHS organisations should continue to take a zero-tolerance approach to all and any form of discrimination," she said.

According to the BMA’s findings, 40 per cent of NHS doctors are from a minority background, compared to 14 per cent of the general public. Of these, 70 per cent have faced some form of racism, but have never made a complaint about it.

One consultant, from a black African background, told the BMA that after reporting previous incidents "no action was taken... I feel uncomfortable and anxious of reprisals".

Nearly 60 per cent of the 2,000 people surveyed said racism had impacted their mental health and 20 per cent say they have considered leaving their job since 2020 because of racist abuse

20 per cent of doctors say the racist abuse they suffered came from patients.
