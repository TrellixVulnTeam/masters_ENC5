Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said that six fire engines had attended the blaze, which was now “under control”.

“We will have a presence on scene for the rest of the day at least”, the spokesperson added.

John Sanderson, an 87-year-old man who lives in the village, told the PA news agency that residents were “devastated”.

“All the roof is gone. I think just the walls are left”, he added.

“I just came back from the supermarket and saw police cars tearing down the road. When I got back I was told the church was on fire,” Mr Sanderson said.

Historic England a public body, told PA it is “saddened” by the news, adding that the building is “a rare surviving example of a medieval, thatched-roofed church”.

“We are liaising with the church and local authority and will look to support them,” it added.

Foreign Secretary and MP for South West Norfolk Liz Truss said she will “do all I can” to assist in the reconstruction of the building.

She wrote in a tweet: “Very sorry to hear of the fire at St Mary’s Church Beachamwell.

“Thank you to @Norfolkfire for tackling the blaze… I will do all I can to assist in the restoration of this beautiful church.”

It is understood the church was closed for repairs at the time of the fire.

The fire service later said they were “scaling down” their response, and thanked residents for their patience.
