MODEL Alexina Graham sparks a chain reaction as she poses in lingerie with body jewellery.

The British star, 31, went for the natural look with minimal make-up and her red hair down.

She also went back to nature recently with a trip to ­Getaway House, just outside New York.

Alexina put a clip online showing her in bed in a cabin with wild deer roaming outside.

The model recently launched her own fashion line.

The Brit started XINA NYC last year after 14 years in the industry.

Alexina will donate five per cent of sales to mental health charities.

She said: “I experienced the struggles that come with not knowing where to turn.

"I wanted to build awareness and break the stigma surrounding mental health.”
