The mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, who ordered the suspensions, said in a statement that Detectives Cronin and Llanos had showed a “lack of sensitivity to the public and failure to follow police policy” in dealing with the grieving families.

“Insensitivity, disrespect in action, or deviation from policy will not be tolerated by me or others in this administration,” Mr. Ganim said.

The detectives will remain on leave until an internal investigation has been completed and any necessary disciplinary action is taken, Mr. Ganim said, adding that both deaths were being actively investigated.

The Bridgeport Police Union Local 1159, which represents the detectives, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ms. Rawls worked as a customer service representative for most of her career. Her sister described her as a family person who was extremely funny. “She loved to laugh and make jokes,” Ms. Washington said. “Even in bad times, she would make a bad situation into a funny situation.”

It is still unclear how she died. There were no physical signs of trauma or foul play, and the medical examiner would determine the cause of death, a spokesman for the department said Monday.

Ms. Smith-Fields died in her apartment after a first date with a man she had met on Bumble, a dating app. The medical examiner’s office said last week that she died from an overdose of fentanyl, prescription medication and alcohol, and ruled her death an accident.
