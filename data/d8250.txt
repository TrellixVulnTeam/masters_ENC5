Eubank Jr heads to Williams’ hometown Cardiff for their middleweight grudge later this month, likely to face the kind of backlash that awaited him in Stuttgart back in 2017.

After a fiery build-up, the 32-year-old was the villain of the piece inside the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle before knocking Yildirim out within three rounds.

A similar atmosphere is likely to await him in the Welsh capital, Eubank Jr believes the lessons he learned in Germany leave him in a good place ahead of the Williams fight.

“I walked out to see signs saying ‘welcome to hell’ and ‘you are going to die’,” he said to Sky Sports.

“People were spitting and shouting at me.

“I was there to do a job, not to get hung up on the crowd.

“The same guys who were booing me were asking for pictures and saying ‘well done’ after.

“I will have more fans in Wales than I did in Germany.

“I need to keep a cool head because the crowd will be crazily screaming for me, and it is easy to get dragged into a fight.”
