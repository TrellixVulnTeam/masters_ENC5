A man with a lengthy rap sheet has been busted in connection to the New Year’s Eve shooting of a 14-year-old girl in Harlem, cops said.

Christopher Fuhrtz, 33, was charged with attempted murder, assault, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment in the Dec. 31 incident, according to police.

The teen was in front of a building on First Avenue near Paladino Avenue, in NYCHA’s Wagner Houses, when she was struck by a bullet just after 1 a.m., police said.

“She was just walking from her relative’s house to her house when she was shot,” a police source said.

Fuhrtz, who was arrested at 120 East 119th Street, has eight prior arrests, including those for robbery, assault, possession of contraband in prison and gang assault, cops said.
