Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) was last seen in Holby City back in 2020, but could she be about to return as she visits nephew Jason (Jules Robertson) in hospital?

In tonight’s episode, Donna (Jaye Jacobs), Jeong (Chan Woo Lim) and Sacha (Bob Barrett) treated Jason – a beloved character who works as a porter in the hospital.

Jason, partner Greta and daughter Guinevere had been involved in a car accident.

While Donna was chatting with Jason, she told him she’d give Serena a phone call and update her.

Jason told Donna that his auntie is currently in Spain with Bernie (Jemma Redgrave) ‘looking at castles’.

As Sacha arrived with some news, Jason didn’t actually reveal why Serena and Bernie were in the middle of looking at castles.

Or maybe, just maybe, they want a castle to be their wedding venue?

Are we clutching at straws here?

Anyways, with Greta at St James’ and Jason recovering, someone needs to help look after young Guinevere…could that be Serena and Bernie?

Given the fact we are nearing ever closer to Holby City’s final episode, it would certainly be a treat for Berena fans to see where the couple’s relationship is at before the last credits roll.
