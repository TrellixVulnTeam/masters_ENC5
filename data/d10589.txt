“I’m an infectious disease worker who has won the Nobel Peace Summit Award for my work with infectious disease, Harvard awards … you know, these kind of things,” Stone boasted to TMZ on Monday. “And I worked with Dr. [Anthony] Fauci for decades.”

“And I just wanna say, COVID is not an opinion-based situation,” she continued. “And Mr. Rogan thinks that his ‘opinion’ or disclaimer for the lives he personally has affected and caused losses of — it’s not an opinion.”

“Mr. Rogan is risking people’s lives with his idiocy and his professing that his thoughts about COVID are opinion,” the “Casino” actress said. “They aren’t opinions. COVID, infectious diseases are science and they are fact-based situations. So, to the pretense that these are opinions is dangerous, and his behavior is dangerous.”

“He should put a disclaimer that he’s an a**hole, and his behavior is dangerous and affecting people’s lives and deaths,” added Stone.

Later in the interview, Stone said her opinion is based on experience, while suggesting Rogan’s podcast guests lack in the area. “I don’t know how many of these people’s opinions come with fact-based experience,” she said.

Notably, one of the most controversial “Joe Rogan Experience” episodes features Dr. Robert Malone, a vaccine scientist who worked on the development of mRNA technology. According to The Washington Post, “Colleagues and critics alike have acknowledged Malone’s impressive credentials in a career spanning more than three decades. Among those accomplishments was serving as CEO and founder of a company contracted by the U.S. government in 2016 to assist in the development of a treatment for the Zika virus.”
