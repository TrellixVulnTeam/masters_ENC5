The deal was confirmed on deadline day after the 39-year-old striker left Rangers.

During two years on Wearside between 2015 and 2017, he hit 33 goals in 74 games and earned fans’ affection after developing a heartwarming friendship with the terminally ill Sunderland supporter, Bradley Lowery.

After completing the move on Monday, Defoe told the club website: “I can’t stop smiling because this is a special move for me for many reasons.

“I’ve had so many messages saying, ‘Remember when you said you would come back’, as I said that I would one day and when I left, I wasn’t ready to leave.

“I have a special bond with the fans here and the club is in a fantastic position to get promoted. I want to be a part of more special times here and I’m looking forward to it.”

Promotion from League One will be the former England star’s main objective with Sunderland third in the table having just sacked manager Lee Johnson, in the aftermath of a 6-0 defeat to Bolton.
