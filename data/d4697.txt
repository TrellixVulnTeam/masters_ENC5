The public will be told if Boris Johnson is given a fine for breaking lockdown rules, Downing Street has said.

Number 10 previously suggested that the names of anyone who is fined, including that of the Prime Minister, may not be disclosed as it was a matter for the Metropolital Police.

Scotland Yard said it would not identify people hit with fixed penalty notices, in line with College of Policing guidance.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: "Obviously we are aware of the significant public interest with regard to the Prime Minister and we would always look to provide what updates we can on him, specifically."

Asked if that meant No 10 would say if he was given a fixed penalty notice, the spokesman said: "Hypothetically, yes."

It comes shortly after a Tory MP announced that he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson after the Sue Gray report into alleged Downing Street parties during lockdown was published yesterday.

Peter Aldous, who has been an MP since 2010, said: "After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the Prime Minister should resign."
