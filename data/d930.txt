Garvey told listeners: “I have learnt so much about the social history and about women’s lives.

“The terrible truth is that when I came to Woman’s Hour, I knew about feminism and I was a feminist but I’m not sure I really saw … I’d wanted to be a radio presenter and I’d become a radio presenter and so I’d think, ‘What are people complaining about?'”

But she added: “During the course of these cataclysmic years on Woman’s Hour, I’ve learnt that actually, for all sorts of reasons, women have to be that bit better, we have to try harder (than men), it’s going to be a bit tougher for us.”

Garvey, who admitted she was “going a bit wobbly” as she signed off the programme, said: “Genuinely, this has been one of the toughest decisions of my life.

“The reason I’m going is because I could have stayed.“I sometimes think the hardest thing is to change when it’s the last thing you want to do but probably the best thing to do.”

But she said change is the “best thing” for the programme which was presented by a man when it first aired.

“It’s not just a radio programme. It’s one of ‘the’ radio programmes and I’ve had a chance to do it,” she said. “The programme needs to move on and now it can.”

Garvey, who will host her own “high-profile” interview series on BBC Radio 4 in April, said she will “forever be known as a former presenter of Woman’s Hour”.

The new series promises interviews of people with “extraordinary stories and experiences to tell from across the UK”.

Garvey’s podcast with Fi Glover – Fortunately… with Fi and Jane – will also become part of the Radio 4 broadcast schedule from January.
