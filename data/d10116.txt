Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The Center for Biological Diversity on Wednesday warned Utah's Bureau of Land Management that it has damaged one of the most significant and earliest Cretaceous track sites in the world and urged the agency to cease its work in eastern Utah.

According to Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the organization, the site features more than 200 dinosaur tracks that have been preserved in sedimentary rock, representing 10 distinct species of dinosaur.
