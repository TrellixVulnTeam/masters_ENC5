Having reached at least the final of every other cup he’s entered in while in charge of the club, it’s hard to see the German treating the 2022 Club World Cup as anything other than a priority, particularly given the collapse of their Premier League title challenge.

As Champions League winners, Chelsea will battle against the conquerors of other footballing continents for overall supremacy in the United Arab Emirates. Originally due to be held in Japan, the tournament was moved into the Middle East due to Covid concerns.

Handed a bye into the semi-finals, Chelsea know only that only Brazilian outfit Palmeiras are in the final four alongside them, although they will not play them. Indeed, it’s either Egyptian side Al Ahly, Auckland City of New Zealand or Al Jazira Club from the UAE who await them.

Here’s all you need to know ahead of the tournament...

The tournament runs between February 3 and February 12 2022.
