Whoopi Goldberg is “livid” after she was suspended by ABC on Tuesday and now she’s threatening to quit ‘The View.’

Goldberg was suspended for two weeks after she repeatedly claimed the Holocaust was “not about race” on Monday’s episode of The View.

“The Holocaust isn’t about race. No, it’s not about race. It’s not about race. It’s about man’s inhumanity to man. That’s what it’s about,” Goldberg said on Monday.

According to The New York Post, Goldberg feels “humiliated” after being disciplined by ABC executives over her Holocaust claims and she’s telling co-workers she’s going to quit.

Whoopi Goldberg is “livid” after she was suspended from “The View” over her claim that the Holocaust was “not about race” — and is telling co-workers she is going to quit the show, according to a source. Goldberg, 66, feels “humiliated” at being disciplined by ABC execs after she followed their advice to apologize for the ill-conceived comments, a well-placed insider told The Post. “She feels ABC executives mishandled this. She followed their playbook. She went on ‘The Late Show With Steven Colbert’ and then apologized again on ‘The View’ the next day,” a source said. The source added that while Goldberg is taking the suspension hard and says she wants to leave the show, insiders believe she’s likely just sounding off. “Her ego has been hurt and she’s telling people she’s going to quit,” the source said. “Suspension from ‘The View’ is like getting suspended from Bravo. The bar is very low.”
