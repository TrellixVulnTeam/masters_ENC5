A Celtic side to have largely been reborn under the stewardship of Ange Postecoglou are only two points behind their bitter rivals and could move ahead with a win in tonight’s Old Firm.

Still, despite the fact that Rangers haven’t been quite as lethal as they were last season, Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side have not lost domestically since August and the Dutchman has steadied the ship admirably in the wake of Steven Gerrard’s departure.

While last week’s dramatic draw with Ross County was slightly concerning, the champions can take an awful lot of the momentum out of the Celtic sails should they avoid defeat in the home of their bitter rivals.

The game, however, comes slightly too early for a certain Aaron Ramsey. Heralded as perhaps the biggest signing to have graced the Scottish Premiership in years and slightly reminiscent of the glory days of the 1990s, the Wales international is not quite ready.
