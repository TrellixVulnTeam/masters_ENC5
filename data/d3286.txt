Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was back at the State House Tuesday to meet with a handful of state lawmakers to discuss the upcoming 2022 elections.

Haley met with Gov. Henry McMaster as well as House and Senate leadership, her spokesman confirmed.

“In the meetings they discussed (the) 2022 elections and how she could be helpful (to) reelect members and building the success of the GOP in statewide elections,” Haley’s spokesman said.

Haley also visited both chambers during her first visit back to the State House since she was governor. Members of the Senate and the House greeted Haley after starting their sessions.

Haley, who left the governor’s office after being appointed by former President Donald Trump as ambassador to the United Nations in 2017, held short meetings with various lawmakers around the State House, Sen. Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said.

“She’s going to be to in town to say, ‘Hello’ to some people,” Massey said before the day’s legislative session began.

Massey said the meetings were scheduled for 10 minutes.

The office of House Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Darlington, declined to comment on his meeting with Haley.

The meetings come ahead of the 2022 elections when the entire 124-member House and governor are up for reelection. Haley is a potential 2024 presidential candidate, but said last year that she would not run if Trump runs.

Haley lives on Kiawah Island, and last year started a political action committee.
