An image of a man who may be able to help after Â£60,000 worth of alcohol was stolen has been released by Scots cops.

Two men had broken into Mammoet Ferry Transport on 101, Cambuslang Road, Glasgow at around 8.45pm on Saturday, January 22.

The thieves were seen entering with an HGV and connecting a trailer which they used to load the alcohol, mostly gin and whisky.

They then left the scene heading along Cambuslang Road.

Officers believe the man seen in the images who was in the area at the time may have information to assist in their enquiries.

They are asking him or any members of the public who recognise him to get in touch.

The man has been described as white and in his 40s or 50s.

He had been wearing a dark jacket under an orange high-viz vest, black gloves and a striped beanie hat at the time.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Greater Glasgow CID on 101 quoting reference number 1168 of Sunday, 23 January, 2022.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
