The United States has proposed allowing Moscow to confirm the absence of cruise missiles at bases in Romania and Bulgaria, according to leaked proposals on defusing the Ukraine crisis.

According to documents obtained by El Pais, Washington has proposed a "transparency mechanism" which would reassure Russia that Tomahawk missiles were not present at bases in the two countries.

Tomahawk missiles would be capable of reaching Russian territory and are a source of concern for Moscow, which has amassed 100,000 troops at its border with Ukraine.

In return, El Pais reported, the United States wants to be allowed to make the same checks at two Russian military bases of its choice. The newspaper has obtained two letters from the United States and Nato which were sent to Moscow last Wednesday.

The leak comes as a senior Russian diplomat mocked Liz Truss over a geography slip the day after Boris Johnson cancelled a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesman, on Wednesday poured scorn on the British foreign secretary over her comment about the UK “supplying and offering extra support into our Baltic allies across the Black Sea.”

Ms Zakharova pointed out that Nato members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are located on or near the Baltic Sea, not the Black Sea which is more than 700 miles to the south-east.

“Where did Mrs Truss get her education and how was she able to occupy several positions in the government with this kind of education? If something needs to be saved, it’s the world that needs to be saved from the stupidity and lack of education of British and American politicians,” Ms Zakharova said.
