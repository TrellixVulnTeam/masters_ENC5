Around 10 fire engines were called to the fire in New Village Avenue, Poplar, shortly after 10.30pm and 20 people were evacuated from the building.

Four were rescued from the fire in the five-roomed flat on the eighth floor of the building, one of whom was taken to hospital.

Fire crews remained on scene throughout the night to make the scene safe.

Station Commander Matt Williams, who was at the scene, said: "Firefighters evacuated 20 people from the building and rescued four people via an internal staircase.

"One of the Brigade’s new 32-metre ladders from Old Kent Road Fire Station was used as a water tower and crews also used drones to provide an aerial view of the incident and increase situational awareness.”

The cause of the fire, which was declared under control by 11.48pm, is under investigation.

Forty calls were taken by 999 about the fire, to which fire crews from Plaistow, East Ham, Greenwich, Shoreditch and surrounding fire stations attended.
