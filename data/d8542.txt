Update: The meeting was delayed after politicians received a flood of phone calls from their constituents. The truckers were filmed praying for those involved in the protest. News about the outcome of the discussion should be made public shortly.

The Canadian trucker convoy protesters making headlines worldwide are hoping to achieve their first victory as Alberta politicians will soon meet with members of a group blocking the Montana/Alberta border.

Video taken by Rebel News reporter Kian Simone shows the demonstrators voting to open one lane of traffic across the border in exchange for the dropping of all rural Alberta mandates and vaccine passports.

Posting the footage online, Simone writes, “Rural MLAs are meeting at 2pm to discuss lifting ALL mandates, in rural Alberta. That’s if the truckers open a lane to the border. The truckers will be opening one lane, on standby to make sure the MLAs keep their word, they will shut it back down if not.”

“If they do not meet our requests, then that border is shut down immediately,” one of the group’s leaders assured the others.

Hoping to show the politicians that they want to work with them in ending the blockade, the truckers opened a lane at the border in good faith that the mandates will be lifted.

Attorney Chad Williamson, who is defending the truckers, called the update “extremely positive.”

Another interesting development in the Canadian trucker convoy saga came when Rebel News captured police providing an alternative account of an alleged assault on an officer.

However, police confirmed the “assault” Kenney was referring to was actually between two citizens who got into a car wreck.
