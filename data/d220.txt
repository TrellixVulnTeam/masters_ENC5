SAN JOSE — A girl was struck and killed by a truck in a collision Wednesday afternoon on the city’s south side, police say.

Just after 1:45 p.m., police responded to the scene of the collision in the 3600 block of Monterey Highway in the city’s Rancho neighborhood, according to a statement Wednesday evening.

When officers arrived, they found the girl suffering from injuries. Firefighters and paramedics took the girl to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The Santa Clara County coroner’s office will release the girl’s identity after confirmation and next-of-kin notification.

Investigators learned that a driver was trying to move the truck off a trailer when the girl jumped on the trailer in the truck’s path, and was struck when the truck rolled forward. Police said the driver is fully cooperating with the investigation.

This marks the city’s 47th traffic fatality of the year, compared with 59 at the same point in 2019. The victim was the 48th pedestrian to die in a collision on a San Jose roadway in 2020. It was the 20th auto-versus-pedestrian case investigated by San Jose police this year, according to data compiled by this news organization.

Anyone with information may call San Jose police Det. Matt Templeman of the department’s traffic unit at 408-277-4654.
