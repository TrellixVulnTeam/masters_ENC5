TRENTON, New Jersey â€“ (Satire News) - The New Jersey state legislature has just passed Food Photo Bill 9011-FP.

The bill passed by a margin of 81 to 19. Senator Gilliano Pintalino, 61, [R- Passaic] authored the bill, which now makes it illegal for anyone in a restaurant to take a photo of their food and send it to relatives, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, or neighbors.

Sen. Pintalino, who has recently lost 117 pounds, stated that his office was receiving upwards of 800 complaints on a weekly basis, from citizens commenting that it is extremely bothersome, irritating, and depressing to be eating a bowl of Ramen, a baloney and cheese sandwich, or a hot pocket, and suddenly in the middle of the meal getting an iphone photo of a t-bone steak, a ribeye, prime rib, tenderloin, or a filet mignon.

The new law, which goes into effect within 72 hours makes it illegal for anyone to transmit food photos over their phones.

The new law states that first time violators will be fined $400, a second offense will result in a fine of $2,000, and a third offense will result in a fine of $9,000 and the photo sender having his or her phone confiscated and held in a locked drawer for 6 days.
