Though Pacific Garden Mission isn’t an official partner of the city’s homeless services division and isn’t included in the 75% of shelter beds funded by the city, Howard said the two do work closely together. The shelter on the Near West Side was housing 500 to 700 people every day under normal operations before the pandemic, Childers of Pacific Garden Mission said. Capacity is down to about 400 currently due to social distancing needs, he said.
