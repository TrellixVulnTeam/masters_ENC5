KELL BROOK is the odds-on favourite to beat Amir Khan as the old foes will finally go toe to toe.

The long-awaited bout will take place on February 19 in Manchester after calling each other out for almost a decade.

Both fighters are nearing the end of their career and they have finally agreed terms to fight as they know it could be their last chance to face off.

Paddy Power have former IBF welterweight world champion Brook the favourite at 4/7.

While Khan is seen as the underdog at 11/8.

Khan, 34, accused 35-year-old Brook of only taking the non-title fight for a final retirement payday.

But Sheffield’s former IBF welterweight champ fired the same dig straight back at the former light-welter champ and revealed how Khan plans to coin a few more quid in before the bell.

Brook revealed: “He is a drama queen, he has a terrible ego, while I am a down-to-earth kid who wants to make the fight at almost any cost.

“I know what we have had to do to make this fight, bend over backwards, and I know this fight has only happened because of me.

“If I go a pound over, it costs me £100,000. Every pound is £100,000 so I cannot afford to do it.

“It makes it interesting and exciting but I am preparing for him now and waiting for this to get confirmed has put me in a bad way before.

“I am excited to put everything on hold and get this fight done.”
