The former U.S. president hopes to know why former Vice President Mike Pence did not question the last election outcome.

Donald Trump wants his one time second-in-command to answer for his failure to challenge electoral college votes that declared Joe Biden the winner.

He proposed a new congressional inquiry to grill Pence about why he did not overturn the 2020 general election results through sending votes back to “various legislators for reassessment.”

“The ‘unselect’ committee should be investigating why [House speaker] Nancy Pelosi did such a poor job of overseeing security, and why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval,” Trump said in a statement.

The Republican claims House Democrat efforts to amend the Electoral College Act, and prevent future vice presidents from rejecting electoral college votes, prove Pence could have overturned the last election result.

“It has now been shown that he clearly had the right to do so,” he said. “The vice president did have this right or, more pointedly, could have sent the votes back to various legislators for reassessment after so much fraud and irregularities were found.”

The former president suspects House Democrats misled the nation into thinking a vice president has “absolutely no right” to uphold electoral integrity.

“[It is] so pathetic to watch the ‘unselect’ committee of political hacks, liars, and traitors work so feverishly to alter the Electoral College Act,” he said.

He believes the Capitol riots never would have escalated, if Pelosi took his security warnings seriously before Jan. 6, 2021.

“If it were sent back to the legislators or if Nancy Pelosi, who is in charge of Capitol security, had taken my recommendation and substantially increased security, there would have been no ‘January 6’ as we know it,” he said.
