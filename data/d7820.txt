Romantic movies have shown us that falling in love is written in the stars and that our other half is somewhere waiting to complete us. And we might be surprised to discover that romantic fate is not only limited to fairy tales. Sometimes, while looking carefully into the life journey of 2 people, we might notice some stunning similarities, making us believe that coincidence doesn’t exist in matters of the heart because everything is carefully planned by the universe.

Bright Side believes that when 2 people are destined to be together, nothing can stand in the way. We’ll share photos that prove how soulmates are magically connected, even before they know it themselves.
