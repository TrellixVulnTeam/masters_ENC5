Former WWE superstar Nia Jax reveals she rejected the chance to return for the Royal Rumble.

The 37-year-old wrestler – who was released from the company in November 2021 after a seven year spell – admitted she was offered a spot in the 30-woman match on Saturday night but had a very blunt response.

Appearing on Renee Paquette on The Sessions podcast, she said: ‘I’m in the middle of getting my stuff back, they sent me a box and more than half was missing. I’m like, “Yo, what is going on?” When I got the call, I thought it was about, “Where is my stuff?”

‘It’s my homie in [Talent Relations]. “Hey, we’re just calling to see if you’d be interested in participating in the Royal Rumble.” I started hysterically laughing. I thought it was my friend joking with me. “Oh, you’re hilarious.”

‘”Actually, this is an official call.” “Oh, f**k no, I’m not coming back.” “We’d like to offer you this.”

‘I said, “First of all, I’m still under my 90 days. You’re still going to be paying me anyway, so you’re not offering me anything. No, I’m not coming back. Absolutely f***ing not. Is this all it was?” “Yes.” “Okay, bye.” ‘

She described the phone call as a slap in the face, and claimed she was on a reserve list of sorts, rather than even being offered a guaranteed spot in the match.

‘That’s exactly what it was,’ she said, as transcribed by Fightful. ‘They were accumulating a list – this is what I was told.

‘They were accumulating a list and wanted to offer me the opportunity, accumulate a list that they send to Vince, then Vince goes through the list and says who he wants and who he doesn’t.’

However, the former Raw Women’s Champion described the offer as ‘such bulls**t’.

She added: ‘I was like, “You’re asking me to be part of a list to go to the next step? F**k no. How much more can you s**t on me?”

‘”We didn’t want her to feel left out. If it got around that she didn’t get ask, we didn’t want her to feel left out.” “F**k you, that’s such bulls**t.” You needed people and I definitely [nixed] that.’
