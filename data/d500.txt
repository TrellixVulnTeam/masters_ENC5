Geza Tarjanyi, 61, was arrested on the doorstep of Mr Javid’s Fulham home after a January 3 demonstration which was filmed and posted online.

It is said Tarjanyi - also known as Gayzer Frackman – was in possession or in control of spray glue and a collection of posters, allegedly intending to use them “to destroy or damage property”.

Appearing at Isleworth Crown Court with his supporters, Tarjanyi pleaded not guilty to a charge of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property.

Judge Martin Edmunds QC, Recorder of Kensington and Chelsea, freed Tarjanyi on bail until a two-day trial starting on October 31.

Tarjanyi, from Leyland in Lancashire, is banned from contacting Mr Javid or his family under the conditions of his bail, and he must also not enter the Hammersmith and Fulham borough.

Footage of the incident which was posted online shows a man being arrested by police, shortly after holding up a letter said to place the Health Secretary "personally on notice" for "harming" people in Britain with vaccines.

According to the criminal charge, Tarjanyi is accused of “having in your custody or under your control spray adhesive and a number of posters” and it is said he was intending to use the items “to destroy or damage property”.

A pre-trial review is scheduled to take place on October 10.
