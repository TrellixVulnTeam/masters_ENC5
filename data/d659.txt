Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz announced Tuesday that Nazieer Basir, 22, has been indicted by a Queens County grand jury and arraigned in Supreme Court on murder, manslaughter and other charges for a deadly shooting in Ozone Park, Queens on December 7th.

District Attorney Katz said, “This is an appalling example of stupid, senseless violence turning deadly. The defendant and victim were allegedly set to attack a group of rivals in a car. The defendant charged here allegedly fired his illegal gun, missed his intended target, and killed his would-be accomplice. This mindless bloodshed must stop.”

Basir, of 106th Street in Jamaica, Queens, was apprehended after fleeing Queens following the shooting. He was arraigned on an indictment charging him with murder in the second degree, manslaughter in the first degree and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree. If convicted, Basir faces up to 25 years-to-life in prison.

According to the charges, just before 10 p.m. on December 7, 2020, Basir and the victim, 22-year-old Royhessny Sintjago, and two others were in the vicinity of 90th Street and Liberty Avenue. The four were allegedly in the process of attacking a group of individuals in a parked car. As the vehicle took off to escape, Sintjago, armed with a tire jack, ran in pursuit. Basir allegedly raised the gun and fired two shots at the car. He missed the car, but one of his bullets struck Sintjago in the face, killing him.

According to the New York Daily News, Sintjago was a known gang member.

The investigation was conducted by Detective Patrick Cahill of the 106th Precinct and Detective Joseph Petrelli of the Queens Homicide Bureau.
