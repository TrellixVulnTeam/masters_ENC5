A KIDDERMINSTER cafe has been handed a new three-out-of-five food hygiene rating.

Pitt Stop Cafe on New Road, Kidderminster, Worcestershire was given the score after assessment on January 11, the Food Standards Agency's website shows.

It means that of Wyre Forest's 120 restaurants, cafes and canteens with ratings, 78 (65 per cent) have ratings of five and just one has a zero rating.

The FSA rates businesses from zero to five so customers can make more informed choices about where to buy and eat food.

A rating of five means hygiene standards are very good, four means hygiene standards are good, three means hygiene standards are generally satisfactory, two means some improvement is necessary, a rating of one means major improvement is necessary and a rating of zero means urgent improvement is required.
