Rather than create a projected 200,000 jobs in January, companies actually cut over 300,000 jobs across America, citing the spread of the Omicron variant, according to ADP’s payroll report.

Private payrolls fell by 301,000 for the month, far below the Dow Jones growth estimate of 200,000 jobs — a differential of half a million jobs.

“The labor market recovery took a step back at the start of 2022 due to the effect of the omicron variant and its significant, though likely temporary, impact to job growth,” ADP’s chief economist, Nela Richardson, said.

Predictably, half the decline came from the leisure and hospitality industry, with a drop of 154,000 jobs.

But major losses were recorded across most job sectors, including manufacturing, trade, transportation, utilities, education, health services, goods production, and other service-providing industries.

This devastating report may explain why Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki tried to blame the upcoming disappointing January jobs numbers on the mild Omicron variant of COVID.

“Because Omicron was so transmissible, nearly 9 million people called in sick in early January when the jobs data was being collected,” Psaki said, adding that the report “may show job losses” as a result.

Likewise, Biden’s economic adviser Brian Deese warned Tuesday that the Omicron variant would impact the January jobs report.

“We never put too much weight on any individual month, this will particularly be true in this month because of the likely effect of the short-term absences from Omicron,” Deese claimed.

What excuse will the Biden administration come up with next when the disappointing jobs numbers continue into February and beyond thanks to restrictive COVID policies and Great Reset initiatives?
