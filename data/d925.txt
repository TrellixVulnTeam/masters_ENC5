A British footballer has died suddenly in Dubai after suffering a heart attack on the pitch.

Amateur footballer Alfie Nunn, who was 35, reportedly died after having a cardiac arrest while playing football last week.

The Sun reports: The Londoner, who played for a number of clubs in southeast London and Kent, including Fisher FC, Croydon FC, Canterbury City, and Beckenham Town, had moved to Dubai several years ago to work as an estate agent.

A colleague at his firm, Haus&Haus, told The Sun Online he had passed away while playing football on Thursday afternoon.

Tributes have poured in for the striker, who grew up in Rotherhithe, Southwark, southeast London.

Alfie’s former physio at Fisher FC, who also play in Rotherhithe, told The Sun Online he was a “great guy, loved by everyone”.

In a statement, the club said: “We have been informed that former Fish midfielder Alfie Nunn, who featured regularly during the 2015/16 season, has passed away after suffering a heart attack while playing in Dubai.

“Our thoughts are with Alfie’s family and friends at this sad time.”
