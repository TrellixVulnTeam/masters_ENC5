DAZN are poised to buy BT Sport and take their Premier League rights.

The Prem are in talks to approve the sale - reportedly for £600million.

BT Sport's £385m deal with the top flight ran from 2019 to 2022 before a three-year roll-over to 2025.

Streaming giants DAZN have long been favourites to purchase the company.

But US media giant Discovery tried to muscle in over the past two months.

Now, though, DAZN seem close to clinching a huge purchase.

Prem clubs have the power to block such a take-over of TV coverage but that seems highly unlikely.

BT Sport landed their extra three years from 2022 to 2025 as part of a Government arrangement aimed at limiting financial problems caused by the Covid pandemic.

The Telegraph say negotiations between BT and DAZN in December stalled over commercial details.

But DAZN's billionaire owner Len Blavatnik is confident of closing the deal.

Discussions with Discovery were understood to be more of a back-up option - almost a safety net.

DAZN has seen revenues soar but losses also rise this decade.

So getting a foothold in one of the world's most poplar leagues of any sport could be a massive boost.
