The U.S. national debt hit and exceeded $30 trillion for the first time in the country’s history Tuesday, Treasury Department data confirmed.

The ballooning debt is largely attributed to the massive social spending prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the end of 2019, the national debt grew by an astonishing $7 trillion. The announcement comes as the Fed is expected to raise interest rates as early as March to curb inflation and an over-heating economy plagued by supply and demand imbalances. The Fed’s likely move will, by default, increase borrowing costs for the U.S. to finance its debt.

Both monetary and fiscal stimulus have been through the roof for the two-year and ongoing Covid-19 crisis. As of December, 80 percent of all US dollars in existence were printed in the previous 22 months. Starting at $4 trillion in January 2020, the debt exploded to $20 trillion in October 2021.

Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the debt had surpassed $30 million rather than trillion.
