The Indian government is blocking a new law which would criminalise marital rape arguing it would “open the floodgates” to false claims.

Women’s rights organisations have reacted with fury to the statement, describing the current law as a colonial era “relic” that has no place in modern India.

The High Court in Delhi is expected to deliver a judgement later this month on whether marital rape should be made a criminal offence, in a hearing brought by two women’s rights organisations.

India is one of around 30 countries in the world where it is still legal for a husband to sexually assault his wife.

“The marital rape exception that exempts husbands from the full force of rape law or when they rape their wives is a British colonial relic. We are before the court now seeking that it is struck down as unconstitutional in modern independent India,” said Karuna Nundy, legal counsel for the petitioners.

But the Indian government has instructed the court to throw out the proposed amendment – which would be enforced across the country – because it says it will lead to women making false claims of rape against their husbands.

The criminalisation of marital rape “could open the floodgates of false cases being made with ulterior motives” and would not be appropriate in India, due to its high levels of illiteracy and cultural norms, the government has said.

Women’s activists say the law is the major reason for marital rapes in India, as men know they can act with impunity

“This law is absolutely outrageous. The provision in the law must be there to make rape in marriage illegal. It is absolutely unacceptable,” said Dr Ranjana Kumari, director of the Delhi-based Centre for Social Research, a leading Indian NGO.

“Rape in marriage is very very widely experienced by women across India, especially in the context of child marriage where young girls get married and they have absolutely no agency to say yes or no because they don’t understand consent.”
