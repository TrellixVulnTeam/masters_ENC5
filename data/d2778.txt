Dubai's police force cruise the streets of the city in multi-million-dollar supercars and possess the fastest squad car in the world.

The city is renowned the world over for being the flashiest place on Earth so it shouldn't come as a surprise at the eyewatering amount of money each police car costs.

According to hotcars.com, Dubai has at least 14 supercars in its fleet including a £270,000 Lamborghini Aventador and ultra-rare $1.4 million(£1m) Aston Martin One-77.

The fastest of these super police cars is reportedly the force's Bugatti Veyron which retails for $1.9 million (£1.4m) and can hit speeds of 254mph.

Of course, as anyone who's ever laughed at a Porche in a London traffic jam knows, supercars rarely get to use their full speeds in cities, but it's still an impressive boast for Dubai.

Dubai's police also own a Mercedes AMG GT 63S which can go from 0-60mph in 3.2 seconds.

In comparison, the Metropolitan Police in London operates with a variety of smaller less expensive cars including the Skoda Kodiaq vRS, which if pushed can go from 0-60mph in 6.8 seconds.

It also costs just £42,000 so you have to ask if the 3 seconds the Dubai police shave off are really worth the dough they're spending.

Amazingly the Dubai police also own one of Elon Musk's rare Tesla Cybertrucks, an electric truck the billionaire believes is the future.

The £30,000 vehicle grabbed the headlines when it was first revealed in 2019, largely for its unusual sci-fi design.

It received more than 250,000 pre-orders early on and offers some impressive specs, including the ability to tow 14,000 pounds and travel from 0 to 60 in just under 2.9 seconds.

How suitable the Cybertruck is for the rigorous of police work remains to be seen.
