Moses J. Moseley, an actor best known for playing a pet zombie on “The Walking Dead,” was found dead last week. He was 31.

The actor was found dead from a gunshot wound inside his car last Wednesday in Stockbridge, Georgia, relatives told TMZ.

His death is being investigated as a possible suicide, law enforcement sources told the outlet.

Moseley gained fame as one of Michonne’s pet zombies for several seasons of AMC’s hit post-apocalyptic horror series.

“Everyone loved Moses. He never met a stranger. He loved his fans as much as his family and friends. He was always excited to get auditions and work,” the actor’s rep, Tabatha Minchew, told Fox News in a statement.

“He was the kind of person who you could call in the middle of the night if you needed to talk or needed anything. He will be deeply missed by so many, his friends, family, costars and fans,” the rep said.

Moseley’s family last heard from him Jan. 23, TMZ reported. On Wednesday, after filing a missing persons’ report, the family tracked his car, where his body was found, with the help of OnStar.

The actor also had a role in “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” and appeared in the HBO series “Watchmen.”
