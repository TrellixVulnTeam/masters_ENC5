One reader, MJav, commented: "Mr Blackford should concentrate on the leader of SNP."

A second, Mac123, wrote: "Double standards. If it was Sturgeon doing exactly what Boris did, Blackford would be defending her. Guaranteed."

Other readers hit out at the SNP's Westminster leader for "showboating".

A third reader, wrote: "Showboating at its worst. The man in is an embarrassment to the Scottish people, should never be allowed to enter the parliament again."

Another added: "Seems he is only there to cause trouble he should be kicked out for good."
