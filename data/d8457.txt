Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite certain advances in cancer therapy, still there is considerable demand for developing efficient therapeutic agents. Nowadays, there is a rising interest in the use of natural-based anti-cancer drugs. In this study, the cytotoxicity of farnesiferol C and microlobin isolated fromwas investigated against MCF-7, HeLa and KYSE cancer cell lines. In addition, the mechanism of binding of these compounds to apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak and Bcl-2) was analyzed by anmethod.We used MTT assay in order to assess the cytotoxicity of compounds against cancer cell lines. Forstudy, the AutoDock 4 was adopted.According to thefindings, in general, farnesiferol C showed significant cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (>50 µM) following 48 and 72 h incubation with the selected cancer cells; however, microlobin exhibited almost no activity at concentrations up to 100 µM. Theresults revealed that both compounds could bind to Bax more efficiently rather than to Bcl-2 or Bak proteins.The results obtained by our preliminaryandstudies suggest that these compounds might induce apoptosis through Bax activation; however further studies, eitherorare needed to clarify these activities.
