Donations are doing exceptionally well. We are more than halfway (now 90%) to our goal in just 12 days of fundraising. I appreciate every dollar, and your money will be used to help CFP grow, as outlined below.

For new readers, this is the first time in the 42-month history of CFP that I have ever allowed donations. And CFP has never run any ads of any sort. Ever. Just to be clear, this site has never asked for donations until 10 days ago. I have never taken a salary or earned a dime from this site. And I have covered all server costs out of pocket for 42 months.

Here’s where your donations will be spent…

330+ readers have signed up for recurring monthly donations.

So far 9000+ people have donated which is ~ 3% of our daily readership of 340,000.

Thank you. I love you all.
