President Trump on Wednesday released a statement following Jeff Zucker’s resignation from CNN.

Mr. Zucker’s relationship with Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer for CNN, was revealed during an investigation into Chris Cuomo’s sexual misconduct.

Although both Zucker and Allison Gollust are divorced, Zucker did not disclose their relationship, as required.

“Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else,” Trump said.

“Now is a chance to put Fake News in the backseat because there may not be anything more important than straightening out the horrendous LameStream Media in our Country, and in the case of CNN, throughout the World. Jeff Zucker is gone-congratulations to all!”

A quick recap of what the newsroom at CNN has looked like in the last year:
• Producer Rick Saleeby forced out for soliciting underage photos and is under criminal investigation
• Jeffrey “Zoomin” Toobin exposed himself during a virtual meeting with colleagues

Mr. Zucker has been widely criticized for not doing enough about the sex scandals, perverts and pedophiles at CNN.

And now we know why! He was involved in his own sex scandal.

CNN’s viewership has plummeted 90% from last year in a critical demographic.

According to a new report by The Daily Mail, CNN averaged 548,000 viewers in the first week of January compared to 2.7 million viewers the same week in 2021.
