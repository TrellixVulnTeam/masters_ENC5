Overpacking is about to get pricier for passengers on Frontier Airlines.

The Denver-based budget carrier isn't raising its checked baggage fees but is lowering the weight limit for the bags to 40 pounds from 50. That means overweight bag fees kick in at 41 pounds, instead of 51 pounds.

The overweight bag fees, which are in addition to the fee to check the bag(s), will be $50 for bags between 41 pounds and 50 pounds and $100 for bags weighing 51 pounds to 100 pounds.

The change takes effect March 1 for tickets purchased on or after Jan. 18, according to Frontier's website.

Travelers who purchased tickets prior to Jan. 18 will still be allowed to check a bag that weighs up to 50 pounds without incurring an overweight bag charge, as will passengers who booked tickets recently for travel through the end of February. For bags over 50 pounds, those passengers will pay the current overweight bag fee of $75.

Frontier isn't the first budget airline to limit checked bags to 40 pounds before collecting overweight bag fees.

Spirit and Allegiant already charge extra fees for bags weighing 41 pounds or more.

Newcomers Avelo Air and Breeze Airways, fellow budget airlines, allow bags up to 50 pounds before charging overweight bag fees.
