LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) — A jury has acquitted a Leavenworth County man of murder in the death of his teenage half brother.

Cody S. Huninghake, 25, was found not guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Robert Nelson, who was shot in the head on July 3 at a home in rural Leavenworth.

Huninghake testified that he accidentally shot Nelson when a dog ran into his leg while he was holding a shotgun. That caused him to fall against a wall and accidentally pull the trigger, the Leavenworth Times reported.

Huninghake said he called his father after the shooting but didn't seek help for Nelson because he “freaked out” and didn't know what to do.

Huninghake was released from the Leavenworth County Jail following the not guilty verdict.
