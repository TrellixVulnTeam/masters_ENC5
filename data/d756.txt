How do you know when you lost a social media flame war? When the guy who PICKS the fight slinks off with a lame apology.

Whoever is (was?) running Walmart’s social media account just learned that lesson the hard way.

When Senator Josh Hawley announced that he would be among those elected officials who would be objecting during the Electoral College process…

…the Walmart Twitter account felt the need to jump in and get political.

Whoever made that snipe was not ready for the clap back.

What did Walmart have to say for itself?

Well, the invocation of an insult to 75 Million Americans seems to have gotten their attention — after all, it isn’t DEMOCRATS that Strzok & Co. were deriding as ‘smelly Walmart people’ were they?

Walmart’s Twitter account later apologized to the senator and said its earlier tweet “was mistakenly posted by a member of our social media team.” “We deleted the post and have no intention of commenting on the subject of certifying the electoral college,” it said. “We apologize to Senator Hawley for this error and any confusion about our position.” Walmart declined to comment on Hawley’s criticisms of the company’s labor practices. –MSN

Declined to comment on the likelihood of slave labor in their Made-In-China merchandise?

That social media staffer should put some aloe on that burn. And take a break from the internet for a while.

Maybe read a book. We have a recommendation…

In Doug Giles’ latest book, Biblical Badasses: The Women, Giles spotlights ten epic ladies who did awesome things for God with the odds severely stacked against them. These girls weren’t your typical church ladies. They were holy movers and shakers who upset hell with their God-honoring, faith-filled, lives. Giles’ unique take on these terrific women makes the scripture come alive. This book is real, raw, relevant, and irreverent. Giles’ prayer is that after reading, Biblical Badasses: The Women, not only will your noggin be filled with these amazing tales of high and lows from real women who rocked in a hard place, via the power of God, but that you will get off your butt, quit pursuing stupidity, start chasing down your high calling and at the end of your life, you too, like the holy femme fatales featured herein, will have left a massive scar on Satan’s haggard backside.
