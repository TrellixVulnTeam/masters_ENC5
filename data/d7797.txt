Trump called the resigning CNN boss "a world-class sleazebag" and slammed the cable news network for having "lost its way with viewers and everybody else."

"Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else," Trump wrote in a Save America message to supporters.

"Now is a chance to put Fake News in the backseat because there may not be anything more important than straightening out the horrendous LameStream Media in our Country, and in the case of CNN, throughout the World. Jeff Zucker is goneâ€”congratulations to all!" the 45th president declared.

Zucker revealed he's exiting the executive position in a memo to colleagues, admitting he failed to disclose "a consensual relationship" with another senior executive at the company. The relationship reportedly came up during the network's investigation into former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who was fired after he meddled in his brother's political affairs amid a sexual misconduct scandal.

"As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo's tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years," Zucker wrote. "I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn't. I was wrong."

After "nine great years," Zucker said he "certainly wish[es] my tenure here had ended differently. But it was an amazing run. And I loved every minute."

Zucker's departure leaves CNN in further uncertainty as its parent company, WarnerMedia, is expected to be acquired later in the year by Discovery Inc. in one of the nation's largest media mergers, The New York Times reported.
