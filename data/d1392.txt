Chuck Schumer’s leadership in the Senate has been a total failure.

He failed to pass two of Biden’s key agenda items, the Build Back Better bill and the voter reform package.

Now he is moving on to one of the left’s favorite pet projects. Gun control.

On Sunday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) pushed for the federal government to allocate $1.5 billion to fund new gun control actions by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). The New York Post reported that Schumer wants to use the funds to get the ATF behind the Interstate Task Force on Illegal Guns. The task force is ubiquitously aimed at getting illegal guns off the streets of New York. Schumer commented his desire to get the ATF involved in the task force, saying, “The ABCs of beating back the scourge of gun violence depends on three federal letters: A, T, and F.” He added, “I am pushing for $1.5 billion dollars in federal funds for the agency, so they can help with this work and do much more at the national level … Without the $1.5 billion … these plans will not have their full impact, and we need full impact to address the flow of these crime guns in our communities and across our state.”

A record number of Americans became first time gun owners last year, mostly due to the out of control crime the country is suffering because of Democrat policies.

This is a terrible idea but Schumer is looking for a Democrat win.

After all the violent crime we’ve seen in the last two years, gun control should be a dead issue.
