A whole galaxy of stars will attend the glittering event being hosted at the O2 Arena.

The music event will see some big changes for the BRITS - namely the removal of gendered categories and a brand new host.

Here is all you need to know.

Which stars have been nominated for the BRIT Awards?

The nominations were announced during an hour-long special titled The Brits Are Coming that aired on ITV on Saturday evening.

Presenters Clara Amfo and Maya Jama announced the shortlist for 13 categories.

The shortlist has the most female nominees in more than a decade.

Eighteen female artists or all-women groups have been nominated, just behind the 22 given the nod in 2010.

Stars with the highest number of nominations include Adele, Ed Sheeran, Little Simz and Dave - each up for four awards.

They will compete against Sam Fender for the inaugural artist of the year award.

Fender, Central Cee and David Guetta are each up for three awards.

Doja Cat, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X are each up for two and will battle it out against Taylor Swift for the international artist of the year award.

Sir Elton John received his first Brit nomination in 20 years, in the song of the year category for his collaboration with Dua Lipa – who is also nominated for the best pop/R&B act gong.

Other nominees include Joy Crookes, Coldplay, Little Mix and KSI.

Best Female and Best Male categories have been replaced by Artist of the Year and International Artist of the Year following years of pressure on BRIT bosses to scrap the categories.

The show will also feature exclusive performances Anne-Marie, Joel Corry & Mabel, Glass Animals and Mimi Webb.

Jama said: “I am so excited to be back on presenting duties for the BRITs 2022! I remember watching the show growing up and still can’t quite believe I get to be a part of it. ‘The BRITs Are Coming’ TV special on ITV has always been one of my favourite shows, it’s such a big celebration, everyone is on top form and I love seeing so many of my favourite people within the music industry come together for such an incredible night.”

When are the BRIT Awards 2022?

The winners will be revealed at the Brit Awards ceremony on Tuesday February 8 at The O2 arena, which will be broadcast on ITV.

Long-running host Jack Whitehall has stepped down and The Masked Singer panellist Mo Gilligan is taking the top position.

Amfo and Jama will also be on hand for presenting duties on the night.

Speaking about hosting the event, Gilligan said: “It’s an absolute privilege to host the 2022 BRIT Awards.

“I’m truly honoured to be asked. We’re already in the extensive planning stages and all I can say is, I promise we’re going to give it all we’ve got to create an incredible night for music fans everywhere. Let’s go!”

How can I watch and stream the BRIT Awards?

It will air live on the night on ITV, with a slight delay to the live show to bleep out any swearing, and will be on ITV Hub for those who miss it.

For the first time, the show will live stream on the Official BRIT Awards YouTube channel for UK and international viewers.

What about the BRIT Awards 2022 Rising Star?

London popstar Bree Runway, Lincolnshire songwriter Holly Humberstone and London balladeer Lola Young were the three shortlisted musicians in the running to scoop the award - with Humberstone confirmed as the winner on December 10.

The news was revealed by Amfo on her BBC Radio 1 Future Sounds show.

Humberstone will have a performing slot on the night of the ceremony in February.

Yes! It was announced Anne-Marie, Bastille and Craig David are among the stars who will play major charity shows for the 2022 BRITs week.

Held in aid of charity War Child, BRITs Week will see a number of top artists play one-off gigs between February 1 and 20. The series of performances coincide with The BRIT Awards 2022 on February 8.

Proceeds from the shows will help to support War Child’s work to help children impacted by conflict.

Damon Albarn, Joy Crookes, Maisie Peters and Mimi Webb will join Anne-Marie, Bastille and David in the series of gigs - with other artists yet to be announced.

Anne-Marie will kick off BRITs Week at Lafayette in Kings Cross on February 1, with musician and songwriter Damon Albarn, founder member of Blur and Gorillaz, closing the event on February 20 at the Troxy in Stepney.
