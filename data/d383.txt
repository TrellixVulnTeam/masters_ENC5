Boris Johnson announced a relaxation of coronavirus rules for five days over the Christmas period, that would have allowed people to mix with up to two other households indoors, from 23 to 25 December. But the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus that is highly transmissible meant these plans could no longer go ahead, with the prime minister abandoning them just days before Christmas.

19 December: Mr Johnson announces London, southeast and east of England to enter new Tier 4 restrictions after exponential rise in cases and amid fears over new coronavirus strain spreading rapidly through the country. The planned relaxation of rules for Christmas were scrapped for those in tier 4, while the rest of England and Wales were limited to meeting up only on Christmas Day.
