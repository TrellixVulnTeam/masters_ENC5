The most important aetiological agent of opportunistic mycoses worldwide isspp. These yeasts can cause severe infections in the host, which may be fatal. Isolates ofoccur with greater frequency and variable resistance patterns. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been recognised as an alternative treatment to kill pathogenic microorganisms. PDT utilises a photosensitizer, which is activated at a specific wavelength and oxygen concentration. Their reaction yields reactive oxygen species that kill the infectious microorganism. A systematic review of new applications of PDT in the management of candidiasis was performed. Of the 222 studies selected for in-depth screening, 84 were included in this study. All the studies reported the antifungal effectiveness, toxicity and dosimetry of treatment with antimicrobial PDT (aPDT) with different photosensitizers againstspp. The manuscripts that are discussed reveal the breadth of the new applications of aPDT againstspp., which are resistant to common antifungals. aPDT has superior performance compared to conventional antifungal therapies. With further studies, aPDT should prove valuable in daily clinical practice.
