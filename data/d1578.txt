Prime minister Boris Johnson is flying to Kiev today to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy amid rising tensions with Moscow.

Mr Johnson will promise to “uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty” amid what the US has described as the threat of an "imminent" Russian invasion.

Meanwhile, US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov are also set to have a meeting today, a day after the two nations clashed at the UN Security Council with Russia accusing the West of stoking fears of war and denying it was acting provocatively.

The US argued that Russia’s growing military force of more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders was “the largest mobilisation” in Europe in decades, and said it was Russia that is guilty of "provocations".

“The discussions about a threat of war is provocative in and of itself. You are almost calling for this, you want it to happen,” Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said at the meeting.
