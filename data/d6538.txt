Joe Biden claimed Tuesday that “the Constitution is always evolving slightly in terms of additional rights or curtailing rights.”

Biden was referring to his upcoming SCOTUS nomination during a meeting with leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Critics have lambasted Biden for vowing to nominate a black woman, arguing that the nomination shouldn’t be based on race and gender, but on how qualified they are for the role.

Addressing reporters, Biden claimed “There’s always a renewed national debate every time a president nominates a justice because the Constitution is always evolving slightly in terms of additional rights or curtailing rights, etcetera. And that’s always an issue.”

Oh really? The Constitution is always changing to TAKE AWAY more rights? Since when?

Biden previously suggested that “no amendment to the Constitution is absolute” referring to the Second Amendment after forcing executive actions on gun control.

On a side note, that fire in the Oval office looks pretty dirty and carbon spewing. Better stamp that out if we’re to build back better.
