“This is not going to be a war of Ukraine and Russia,” should diplomatic efforts fail, he said. “This is going to be a European war, a full-fledged war.”

While Mr. Johnson tried to keep the focus on Russia, he was instantly put on the defensive by aggressive questioning about a scandal over illicit parties during the pandemic that is imperiling his hold on office. “On the issue of Ukraine,” one reporter asked, “why should the international community take your diplomacy seriously when you’re so preoccupied?”

Mr. Johnson dodged most of the questions about his troubles at home. But pressed on whether he would release an unredacted report by a senior civil servant investigating the parties, Mr. Johnson replied, “Of course we’ll publish everything as soon as the process is completed.”

For weeks, Russia has been insisting that the current crisis is not just about Ukraine, but about a European security architecture that fails to take Russia’s interests into account. Last December, as American officials started raising alarms about what they said was a Russian troop buildup, Moscow issued written demands for “security guarantees.” They included that NATO, the Western military alliance, not expand eastward, guaranteeing that Ukraine will never join it, and that NATO draw down forces in Eastern European countries formerly part of the Soviet Union or its orbit.

Mr. Putin said these were existential issues that Russia was determined to finally resolve. But many analysts and Western officials interpreted his stance as an attempt to create a pretext for possible military action against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that Mr. Putin has wanted to reinsert into Russia’s sphere of influence ever since Ukraine’s pro-Western revolution in 2014.
