"Love and partnership isn’t guaranteed to everyone. Growing up, I didn’t have a big interest in having a boyfriend but always assumed I’d find the 'The One' because that’s what always happens, right? Wrong. I’ve been single my whole life but suddenly… it didn't bother me anymore. I learned that being single is not a death sentence, it’s still a life worth living and it’s no less fulfilling than a married one. Having a partner is not the achievement we are taught it is, and our lives certainly don’t depend on it."
