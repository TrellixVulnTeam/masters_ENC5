Cy the Cynic says that when opportunity knocks, some people will just complain about the racket.

Well, other people just pay no attention at all. Against today’s four spades, West led the king of hearts, and South took dummy’s ace and drew trumps with the king and queen. He next cashed the A-K of clubs and led a third club. When the clubs broke 3-3, dummy’s fourth club was a winner.

But East shifted to the jack of diamonds, and West took the ace and queen and cashed his jack of hearts for down one.

South ignored his opportunity. He should try to set up the clubs without losing the lead to East. After South draws trumps, he should lead a heart. West takes the jack and leads the queen, and South does not ruff but instead discards a club — a loser on a loser. He wins West’s club shift with the king, takes the ace and ruffs a club.

When the suit breaks evenly, South can go to dummy and pitch a diamond on the good club, losing only two hearts and one diamond.

Your partner opens one spade, and you respond 2NT, a conventional forcing raise. Partner then bids three clubs. What do you say?

ANSWER: In conjunction with your 2NT response, partner’s three clubs shows a singleton club. The idea is to help you judge whether your have useful cards for slam. Since your ace is an ideal card, you can encourage. Cue-bid three hearts. Partner may hold K Q 10 5 3, K Q 7 2, A 4 3, 2.
