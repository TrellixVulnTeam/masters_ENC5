The sight of today’s dummy must have pleased South, but when West shifted to a trump at the second trick, North’s raise to four hearts began to look like an oversight. East took the ace and returned a trump, and South couldn’t ruff any diamonds in dummy.

South saw only nine tricks: five trumps, two clubs and two spades. Where could he find another?

South had enough foresight to plan an end play. He drew the missing trump and then, showing great insight, he took the A-K of spades, ruffed a spade, led a club to dummy and led a fourth spade.

When East followed, South pitched a diamond. East then had to lead a club — all he had left — and declarer won in dummy and took the good fifth spade. Well done!

This deal arose long ago. Most modern experts would open one spade as North. They would judge it better to get the major suit mentioned quickly and make it harder for the opponents to enter the auction.

You hold: S 4 H K J 10 7 5 2 D J 7 6 4 3 C 4. You are the dealer, neither side vulnerable. What is your opening call?

ANSWER: This is a matter of personal style and temperament. At matchpoint duplicate, many players adopt a bold competitive style and preempt freely, without regard for the textbook requirements. They might open three hearts. At party bridge or IMP scoring, where avoiding disasters is a factor, more players would be apt to pass.
