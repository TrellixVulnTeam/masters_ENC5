Dundee City Council has issued recycling advice including what to do with dead animals.

The easy to use A-Z guide appears on its website with useful phone numbers and instructions.

Some of the more unusual items covered by the guide include dental floss, junk mail, loft insulation and asbestos.

The website also includes instructions on how to deal with ‘ dead animals.’

It describes carcasses as ‘special or hazardous’ waste and advises locals to immediately phone environmental management.

Just last year the council introduced a policy limiting the number of general waste bins available to households and discouraged people from leaving extra waste outside.

Following the introduction of this policy its waste collection teams only empty one general waste bin from each household unless residents have obtained, and are displaying, a valid permit on their additional bin.
