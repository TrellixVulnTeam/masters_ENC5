Over at the White House, Joe Biden is now meeting with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in the Oval Office.

Reporters were allowed in to the Oval Office for the start of the meeting, and the president addressed the latest developments in connection to the crisis in Ukraine.

Biden noted that he spoke to the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, last Thursday, and the two nations are engaged in “nonstop diplomacy” as they monitor the threat of a potential Russian invasion.

The president applauded officials from the US and allied countries for outlining the threat of escalating Russian aggression at the UN Security Council meeting earlier today.

“We continue to urge diplomacy as the best way forward,” Biden said. “But with Russia continuing its buildup of its forces around Ukraine, we are ready no matter what happens.”
