AUSTIN, Texas — An appeals court in Texas dismissed claims against the city of Austin brought by the family of a man who shot himself in the head while handcuffed and seated in the backseat of a police patrol car. The family’s claims that a police officer’s failure to fasten the man’s seatbelt caused his death fail, because the death “was not proximately caused by the unfastened seatbelt.”
