The Honeybee Bakery in Glasgow, run by award-winning baker Vittoria, produces stunning cakes, breads, biscuits and confectionery. Here are a few examples – try not to drool on your phone/laptop.

Admit it – you drooled, didn’t you?

The problem with producing such tempting treats, apart from stopping yourself from eating them all, is that everybody will want them – even people who aren’t prepared to pay the full price.

Over on Reddit’s r/ChoosingBeggars forum, u/Poverty123 has shared a very telling photo from the bakery that needs to be shown to every social media ‘influencer’ considering trying to get something for nothing, and the ‘Would you do it for this much?’ brigade.

Good luck haggling over the price of a steak in your local restaurant. Redditors loved the clear statement, and were pretty irate about the idiots who make things like that necessary.

I’m a cake decorator. Most customers are very sensible but every now and then you’ll get a Karen who’s just shocked that I can’t make the $200 cake she found on Pinterest for $30 by tomorrow for her little Breigh-Lyyne’s second birthday party.

If you live in Glasgow, lucky you. You can go and treat yourself – but no haggling. You can follow the bakery on Facebook and Instagram wherever you are in the world.

Homophobes took their bigotry out on a small bakery and the result was pretty sweet
