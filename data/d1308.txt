The BBC 's Laura Kuenssberg has pinpointed a "staggering" finding within the report published by senior civil servant Sue Gray into the lockdown gatherings hosted at Number 10 Downing Street. Ms Kuenssberg believes the "most serious one" of the alleged parties is the one hosted in the Prime Minister's private residence.

Ms Kuenssberg told the Newscast podcast: "One of the events that the police are investigating is something that took place in the Downing Street flat and something that Downing Street have always said didn't take place.

"And the Prime Minister himself has never been pinned down on whether or not he was at that event, Downing Street has always denied it.

"But you know, it is quite staggering if you'd said to someone two or three months ago before this all began oh, by the way, there's an investigation into whether or not there was a do in Downing Street that broke the law during lockdown, in the flat, you would have been like, what!?

"I think potentially that's the most serious one for Boris Johnson because what Downing Street has often tried to hang this on well, it was a workplace people were doing the right thing, sometimes it was COVID secure, okay, maybe we got a few things wrong.
