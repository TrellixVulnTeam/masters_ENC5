There are some scary times ahead for Dawn Taylor (Olivia Bromley) in Emmerdale soon as she prepares for her wedding to Billy Fletcher (Jay Kontzle).

She’s having problems at work and apparently making mistakes, which leads to her being disciplined. Dawn is comforted by Billy about her problems at work, and also her worry that Alex will take her to court over Lucas.

But what Dawn doesn’t realise is that a sinister figure is watching her from a distance.

Later, Dawn tries on her wedding dress. She looks beautiful in it and Harriet (Katherine Dow Blyton) is choked up.

So imagine Dawn’s horror when she pops back later from her hen do to get her phone – and sees that her gorgeous wedding dress has been slashed and ruined.

Could it be the work of Meena (Paige Sandhu), back to wreak revenge?

As Dawn hears the door creak she realises that the back door is ajar. She grabs a bat and heads outside, determined to confront whoever slashed her dress.

As Dawn braces herself for the fight of her life, will she ever see her wedding day?
