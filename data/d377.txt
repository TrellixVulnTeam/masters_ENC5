Last week, Ron Johnson created quite a bit of controversy when he said that he was against government sponsored child care because other people's children shouldn't be such a burden for taxpayers.

Stephen Colbert took the ball and ran, writing and singing Ron Johnson's campaign theme song, which would be much funnier if it wasn't so accurate.

I hope Colbert has a copyright on that song or else RoJo will try to steal that too.
