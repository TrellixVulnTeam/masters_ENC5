LOVE Island star Luke Trotman looked almost unrecognisable as he showed off a new look after splitting from Siannise Fudge.

The 24-year-old star, a semi-pro footballer before his stint in the villa, has dyed his hair pink and grown a beard.

He showed off the startling makeover on Instagram, taking a picture in the mirror of the lift in the building he once shared with Siannise.

The reality star told fans: "The hair is settling down well. I like it."

Some of his celebrity followers weighed in with their appreciation with Dan Osborne remarking: "Looking good bro! Hope you‚Äôre well üôåüèº."

Luke and Siannise had a whirlwind romance on the show, hooking up on the first and only winter edition in South Africa in 2020.

They moved in together in Southwest London soon after but when they stopped posting pictures of one another fans predicted they had split.

A source confirmed to The Sun in November last year: "It's been a really hard couple of weeks for both of them but it's over for now."

The break-up left Paige Turley and Finn Tapp and Callum jones and Molly Smith are the only two couples left standing from Winter Love Island.

Last month Siannise showed off her new London pad after moving out of the flat she shared with Luke.

After a stint living back home with her family in Bristol she returned to the capital with a suitcase heaving with cleaning products courtesy of her mum.
