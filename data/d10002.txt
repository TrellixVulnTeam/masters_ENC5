Pancake Day is round the corner – and it's an ideal opportunity to test your cooking and flipping skills in the kitchen.

This easy pancake recipe, with only three ingredients, is perfect for any pancake-flipping novice. Just add lemon and sugar to keep the dish simple, or soak in syrup and chocolate sauce for a more decadent version.

It can easily be doubled or tripled to make as many as you like – any uneaten pancakes will keep in a stack for 24 hours or can be frozen. So if you're too full on the day, you can continue your topping experiments after Pancake Day!

Do not worry if the first pancake or two is a failure: it acts as a test for the consistency of the batter and the heat of the pan, and if you are new to pancake making you may prefer to make them slightly thicker, to be on the safe side, in which case you may only make eight.

Prep time: 5 minutes, plus 30 minutes for the batter to stand
• Sift 125g plain flour into a bowl and make a well in the middle. Whisk together one egg, one egg yolk and a little milk taken from the 300ml, then pour into the well. Whisk with a little of the flour.
• Gradually whisk in half of the remaining milk, drawing in the rest of the flour a little at a time, to make a smooth batter. Stir in the remaining milk. Cover and leave to stand for about 30 minutes.
• Heat the frying pan and brush with a little oil.
• Ladle two or three tablespoons of batter into the pan and tilt the pan so that the batter spreads out evenly over the bottom.
• Cook the pancake over a medium-high heat for 45-60 seconds until small holes appear on the surface, the underside is lightly browned and the edge has started to curl. Loosen the pancake and turn it over by tossing or flipping it with a palette knife. Cook the other side for about 30 seconds until golden. Slide the pancake out of the pan.
• Heat and lightly grease the pan again before making the next pancake. Serve the pancakes as they are made, or stack them on a plate and reheat before serving. (If the pancakes are hot when you stack them they will not stick together; there is no need to interleave them with greaseproof paper.)
