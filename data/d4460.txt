“We have multiple drayage companies champing at the bit,” he said, referring to short-haul trucking firms. “People are looking for ways to get this done.”

Because some containers arriving from the ports include stacked boxes of goods that need to be removed individually and cannot be taken out with a forklift, his company is offering to unload containers and supply pallets for the next delivery, which his own trucking service can provide.

In the past two years, his company has expanded the warehouse space it leases from one building with 40,000 square feet to four buildings with 300,000 square feet. Even if the slowdown in the supply chain eases, the challenges it has highlighted are not going away anytime soon, Mr. Sanguinetti said.

What little space there is can be off the market before many even know about it.

“Space is limited — buildings are leased almost as fast as people are signing for space, let alone built,” said Robert Coon, the chief commercial officer for Dotcom Distribution, which leases space in Edison, N.J., from Prologis, a real estate investment trust that backs warehouses. The company uses its warehouse space to store beauty products, toys and other items for about 20 retailers.

The company’s lease is up in 2023, and Mr. Coon has already begun to think about the next steps. Dotcom has been in the space for 21 years, and it is seeking bids for alternatives. But Mr. Coon isn’t ruling out staying put, despite what he predicts could be a substantial rent increase.
