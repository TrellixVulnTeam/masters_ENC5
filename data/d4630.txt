A PRIMARY school has "burnt to the ground" after a huge blaze broke out, according to witnesses.

Cops rushed to the scene after an intruder alarm went off and arrested a man, who was taken to hospital for treatment.

Horrified onlookers watched as the fire tore through Ash Green school in Mixenden, Halifax, just before 8pm this evening.

West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service confirmed a one-storey extension is "100 per cent involved" in the blaze.

Ten fire engines and one aerial ladder platform were used to subdue the flames.

It is not yet known if anyone was injured, but locals have been urged to stay inside with their windows shut.

Horrified onlookers took to social media to share their shock.

"Hope all safe around it."

David Patrick added: "What a nightmare to watch this school go up so sad."

"School is some children's escape, some children's only meal, some children's only form of socialising and not to mention how important education is for them all.

"I feel really sorry for the children, also the teachers and staff who will probably (hopefully not) lose their only source of income.

"What an absolute mess. Thinking of all those affected.

"If any parents need help with childcare or food etc Iâ€™m happy to help! Much love to everyone in Mixenden who will be affected."
