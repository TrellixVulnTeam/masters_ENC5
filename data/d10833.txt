If you’re one of the several billion humans who have heard 50 Cent’s “In Da Club” this century, you may have spent a moment or two admiring the concision of the chorus chant “I’m into having sex, I ain’t into making love” — possibly while burning calories on an elliptical, or waiting for your vodka soda. But it is unlikely that you’ve thought about this line as hard, or for as long, as Daniel Levin Becker, who opens “What’s Good: Notes on Rap and Language” with a meditation on the line’s philosophical implications.

A critic and translator — and one of just two Americans to be inducted into the French literary collective Oulipo — Levin Becker is also a helpless and lifelong rap fan who has logged many unpaid hours poring over the crowdsourced lyric-annotation website Genius (formerly Rap Genius), suggesting alternate meanings or correcting transcription errors. Levin Becker puts all of his accumulated knowledge to work in “What’s Good,” an often hilarious, surprisingly moving and always joyful paean to rap’s relationship to words.

The “notes” in the subtitle is correct: This is not a thesis, an argument or a history. Like Shea Serrano’s best-selling rap compendiums, “What’s Good” welcomes you on almost any page you turn to, but builds sneaky resonances for those reading straight through. Levin Becker borrows more than a few tricks from the artists he’s studying, and he’s also clearly learned more than a little from the hip-hop writer Dave Tompkins, whose dizzying involutions and verbal acrobatics come closest to the anarchic feel of rap music. Picture a Tompkins weaned on Action Bronson, Das Racist and Drake instead of Rammellzee and Afrika Bambaataa, and you’ve more or less got Levin Becker, who treats the language games of all rappers with equal seriousness.
