Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood has been released on bail pending ‘further investigation’, after being questioned on allegations of rape, sexual assault and threats to kill.

Greater Manchester Police said it was aware of ‘social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence’ and confirmed that a man in his 20s had been arrested.

Greenwood – who has been suspended by his club ‘until further notice’ – spent three nights in custody after Greater Manchester Police were granted additional time to question the England international.

On Tuesday afternoon, they also confirmed that Greenwood had been further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and threats to kill.

Following that extra time for questioning, Greater Manchester Police have now confirmed that Greenwood has been released from custody pending further investigation.

‘A 20-year-old man arrested on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman has been released on bail pending further investigation,’ a police spokesperson said.

Greenwood remains suspended by his club until further notice.

The 20-year-old made his debut for the Red Devils in 2019 and he signed a four-year deal worth £100,000-a-week in 2021.

Greenwood came through the club’s academy, which he joined at the age of eight.
