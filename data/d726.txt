As the open-ended anti-vaccine mandate protest lining the streets surrounding Parliament Hill heads into a fourth day, a new political psychodrama has started to play out within the walls of the precinct itself, courtesy of what the Globe and Mail describes as a “caucus revolt” targeting embattled Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole, who could see his job performance put to a secret ballot vote as early as Wednesday.

According to the Globe, 35 MPs co-signed a letter to caucus chair Scott Reid requesting a leadership review — well over the 20 percent minimum threshold required by the rules adopted by the party last fall — and, according to two unnamed sources, “at least 63 of the 119 elected Conservative MPs are willing to vote against (O’Toole),” at which point MPs “would have to elect an interim leader while the Conservative Party calls a leadership race.”

In a statement posted to Twitter last night, O’Toole made it clear that he was ready for a fight.

“I’m not going anywhere and I’m not turning back,” he tweeted.

“Canada needs us to be united and serious! It’s time for a reckoning. To settle this in caucus. Right here. Right now. Once and for all.”

With all eyes focused, at least for the moment, on his cross-aisle rival, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — who revealed yesterday that he has tested positive for COVID-19 — is set to spend the day ensconced in “private” — and, given his status, presumably entirely virtual — “meetings,” starting with his regularly-scheduled Tuesday morning chat with his front bench team.

According to his daily itinerary, he’s also booked a call with French president Emmanuel Macron, as well as back-to-back briefings from COVID-19 Immunity Task Force co-chair David Naylor and Chief Science Advisor Mona Nemer.

He will not, however, be firing up his webcam to take questions from across the aisle this afternoon, but will leave that to his second-in-command, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. (2 PM)

As per his office, New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh will “participate virtually” in question period, and is also booked in for closed-door meetings with representatives from the Dairy Farmers of Canada and B.C. Dairy Association (3:30 PM)

Finally, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet will head to the West Block press theate to share his — and his party’s — views on how the government is handling the protest. (11 AM)

MPs will have one final day to air their thoughts — and concerns — over the priorities outlined in Team Trudeau’s latest throne speech before it goes to a final vote later this afternoon — one that, it’s worth noting, is automatically deemed a confidence question, although as yet, there’s no indication that a critical mass of opposition members are preparing to use their combined majority clout to trigger a snap election by bringing down the government.
