Is this like conservatives abandoning Twitter for Parler?

Actually, no. Sounds a bit more like people threatening to move to Canada if we pass "socialized" medicine. Because, uh, where the fuck are they gonna go for cheaper shit brought to you by workers who have been more cruelly exploited?

Seems that Walmart's Twitter account responded to Sen. John Hawley's declaration that he will object to the election results on January 6—a feckless gesture directed entirely toward an audience of one man and his tweetin' toilet.

Yeah, that's all bullshit, and he knows it. And his little tantrum will do nothing but force his fellow congressfolks to stay late after school, to everyone's eternal irritation and chagrin. But it will keep him viable as a 2024 presidential candidate. So that's what that's all about.

And then came the empty threats:

And even after Walmart issued an apology, the barbarians kept shouting:

Sure, Trump supporters. Boycott Walmart. Like you're going to find Toby Keith-branded underpants for cheaper somehow.

Still, my favorite part about a #Boycott hashtag is when it gets highjacked by our side.

So, yeah, I give this "boycott" about two days, or until Walmart slashes its price on jumbo tubs of Red Vines, whichever comes first.

Until then — MAGA! Unless, of course, Target runs out of TruckNutz. Because you can only go so far with such things. Am I right?
