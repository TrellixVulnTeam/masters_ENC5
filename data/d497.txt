The Dane completed a remarkable return to the Premier League on transfer deadline day, signing with the Bees until the end of the season.

Eriksen, who is yet to arrive in the UK and has been training with the youth sides at Ajax, hopes to begin working with his new teammates next week.

The former Tottenham star has been a free agent since his contract was terminated at Inter Milan due to Serie A’s rules that disallow people from playing with an internal heart-starter fitted.

Saturday’s trip to Everton in the FA Cup and the Bees’ visit to champions Manchester City next Wednesday are expected to come too soon for the midfielder as he builds up match fitness.

That leaves the London derby, at home to Palace, as a more realistic target.

Brentford boss Thomas Frank, who coached Eriksen for Denmark's Under-17s side, said at his announcement: “We have taken an unbelievable opportunity to bring a world-class player to Brentford.

“He hasn’t trained with a team for seven months but has done a lot of work on his own. He is fit but we will need to get him match fit and I am looking forward to seeing him work with the players and staff to get back towards his highest level.”
