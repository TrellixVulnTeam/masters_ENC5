Dead people may get some of the $600 stimulus checks the federal government began issuing Tuesday night.

That would mirror what happened this past spring, when deceased individuals were among the recipients of a prior round of direct payments, of up to $1,200 per person.

More than 1 million decedents had gotten a check by the end of April, worth a collective $1.4 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office. The IRS asked for that money back, leading to confusion and whiplash for heirs such as surviving spouses and family members.

Now, a $900 billion Covid relief package, which President Donald Trump signed into law Sunday, may create a similar situation, though Congress put a firewall in place to limit its scope, according to tax experts.

The IRS and Treasury Department didn't return a request for comment.

The law, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021, provides a one-time payment of up to $600 per person and $600 per dependent child. A family of four, for example, could get up to $2,400.
