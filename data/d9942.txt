KATIE Price found a topless poster from her glamour modelling days in her Mucky Mansion tonight and joked "they don't look like that now."

The 43-year-old star has been renovating her home and clearing out junk from her past in the candid Channel 4 series.

In the second episode, Katie sorted through piles of posters and photos from when she posed for lads mag shoots and came across a mug with her photo on it.

She told the cameras: "Isn't it funny how you change.

"That was my second boob job. I've had loads since then."

Katie made viewers giggle when she added: "My areolas don't look like that any more! They've been chopped on and off so many times."

Reacting to the second episode on Twitter, one person said: "She's clearly a good laugh, down to earth, loves her kids and wants the best for them.

"But my god, her fingernails aren't compatible for home renovation and crafting"

Another said: "Katie Price is the greatest Briton on earth, makes great telly, hun, loves her kids. Whatâ€™s not to like?"

The star first went under the knife in 1998, boosting her breasts to a 32C and has gone both up and down in size since then.

In 2015 she removed all traces of implants and returned to her natural bust size for the first time in 16 years.

But the following year she revealed on Loose Women that she'd changed her mind for her sixth boob job.

She said a surgeon had asked what she wanted done, with the star replying: "Oh go - bigger then!"

Last year, the star showed the scars she had been left with following surgery as she stripped to a bikini in Turkey after her 11th boob job .

She added: "That's the first time I've gone to a different surgeon. I had to go back to Frank with my head down, ashamed that I'd been to another clinic.

"His first words were: 'What the f*** have they done?' He had to correct them for me."

She explained that she'd had the new 1,050cc implants put in last year.
