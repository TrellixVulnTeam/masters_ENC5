CNN’s Brian Stelter was mocked this week after he complained during a segment on the left-wing network about the number of Americans that trust Joe Rogan more than CNN.

Stelter responded to a statement that Rogan put out that said that he wanted to show all kinds of different opinions by saying, “Which sounds great, but not all opinions are created equal.”

“You think about major newsrooms like CNN that have health departments and desks and operations that work hard on verifying information on COVID-19,” Stelter said. “And then you have talk show stars like Joe Rogan, who just wing it, who make it up as they go along. And because figures like Rogan are trusted by people that don’t trust real newsrooms, we have tension, a problem that’s much bigger than Spotify, much bigger than any single platform, but that’s what is the heart of this right now.”
• Reagan Battalion: “This is what this is about. People like @brianstelter would much rather shut down people like @joerogan , who are far more popular than they or their networks are, instead of doing some soul searching to figure out why people like Rogan are far more popular and trusted.”
• Beverly Hallberg, District Media Group: “Beware of the mindset that sharing various opinions is dangerous.”
• Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC): “The “newsroom” that pushed 4 years of Russia collusion and ‘mostly peaceful’ protests, or downplayed stories such as covid’s origins, can’t figure out why people started tuning them out.”
• Erick Erickson, radio host: “If the media would engage in just a little bit of self-reflection they might figure out why Joe Rogan gets more listeners/viewers.”
• Ian Miles Cheong, writer: “Most people would sooner trust a drug addicted homeless bum than listen to any of the talking heads on CNN.”
• Ned Ryun, political commentator: “I’d probably trust random names from a phone book more than the ‘newsrooms’ like CNN.”
• Mike Hahn, former Trump official: “Not once do these morons ever ask ‘why does nobody trust us?'”
• Nick Short, political commentator: “‘Newsrooms’ like CNN do not report the news, they create propaganda about the news then report it. That’s a much bigger problem than Joe Rogan or Spotify @brianstelter .”
• Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist: “I trust perhaps everyone else in the world more than I trust the propaganda press/TV. No one has decisively proven their untrustworthiness more than our corrupt media.”
• Leon Wolf, The Blaze: “Be less self-aware, Brian. If you can.”
• Dan Gainor, NewsBusters: “If CNN wants to fix the problem, then they shouldn’t suck so much.”
• Nick Gillespie, Reason: “More signs this is in some large way a pissing match between old/sunset media and new/sunrise media. @CNN / print vs. @Spotify / interwebs.”
• Accuracy In Media: “Brian thinks very highly of himself.”
