It was just another day in the city of Orlando. The sun was shining brightly; the folks were out and about. I’m sure many tourists excitedly buzzed around, anxious to see Disney World. And as the cars whizzed by on the Orlando highways, a scene was playing out on a lonely overpass.

A group of strange-looking individuals milled around. Perhaps you even saw them? Nothing wrong so far, right? Overpasses often get kids hanging around, bored kids, listening to the cars whiz by and the sounds of the hazy day. Only these overpass goers were different. They were not your average everyday hangers-out. Not at all. These were Nazis.

And they were doing what Nazis tend to do. Flashing messages of hate, yelling and waving antisemitic slogans, including a swastika flag. These people were arrogant, wicked, and gleaming with hate. They just couldn’t wait to stir up trouble and desecrate Florida with their malicious sleaze.

So, the hate-fest was eventually broken up. But not before outrage had hurtled the story into prime-time and national news. And Ron DeSantis? The Governor of Florida? He did nothing. Even when people asked him point-blank to denounce the activities — he did nothing. He first accused the Nazis of maybe not being real Nazis.

He did nothing. DeSantis them viciously attacked Democrats in a desperate attempt to change the subject. It didn’t work. And still, he did nothing. For once, (most) media didn’t “both sides” it. DeSantis and his treacherous actions went national — heck, they went international — and still, the “man” did nothing.

Except accuse people of trying to “smear” him. Florida, please listen. Open your eyes. This man doesn’t care about you. WHAT has he done for you? Nothing. Look at him through glasses that are not rose-colored. See him for what he is. And think about it. What if YOU were the one who was the subject of racist attacks? What if YOU were the one who desperately needed help? I’m sure your Governor would do nothing.
