MANCHESTER UNITED will wear white socks and not their usual black ones for their FA Cup tie at home to Middlesbrough.

The club have decided on the change 'to avoid potential issues for colour-blind fans and viewers'.

According to MailOnline, United have decided on the colour change to 'help increase the visual contrast'.

Middlesbrough only have two options for their socks - red or green, so United believe wearing white will clash more.

But changing their socks or not, United could have a tough time of it on Friday night, according to former Boro boss Neil Warnock.

Warnock left Boro in November after being replaced by Chris Wilder in the Riverside dug-out.

But he believes the Championship side have a good chance of producing an upset against the 12-time FA Cup winners at Old Trafford as his old club have better defenders.

Warnock told talkSPORT Breakfast: “They’ve got great individuals but not a team and I don’t see that coming.

“They’ve got my old team Middlesbrough in the next round of the FA Cup and I wouldn’t swap any of their defenders for the back three at Middlesbrough – Dael Fry, Anfernee Dijksteele and Paddy McNair.

“I think they’re better than Man United‘s defence.”

United will be without Donny van de Beek for the FA Cup clash - the Dutch midfielder completed a loan deal to Everton for the rest of the season.

But Jesse Lingard could be in line for a rare start after the club BLOCKED him joining West Ham in some last-minute deadline-day drama.
