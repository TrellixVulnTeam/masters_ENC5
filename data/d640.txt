As Birmingham and the rest of the West Midlands enters Tier 4, shoppers are asking if retailers such as Primark are affected by the restrictions.

The world's biggest Primark is in Birmingham city centre, where it opened in April 2019.

Primark said in a statement on its website: "In line with Government guidance, some of our stores are temporarily closed. Please check your local store for updated information."

The megastore in Birmingham is among those affected by the Tier 4 rules.

The Midlands branches that are shut are:

Those branches in the Midlands that are still open because they are in a Tier 3 area are:

But note that travel from a Tier 4 to a lower tier area is not permitted if you just want to make a dash to a Primark store.

The Government guidance says you must stay at home and not leave your Tier 4 area, other than for legally permitted reasons such as:
• travel to work where you cannot work from home
• travel to education and for caring responsibilities
• visit or stay overnight with people in your support bubble, or your childcare bubble for childcare purposes
• attend hospital, GP and other medical appointments or visits where you have had an accident or are concerned about your health
• to provide emergency assistance, and to avoid injury or illness, or to escape a risk of harm (such as domestic abuse)

Non-essential includes clothing and homeware stores, vehicle showrooms (other than for rental), betting shops, tailors, tobacco and vape shops, electronic goods and mobile phone shops, auction houses (except for auctions of livestock or agricultural equipment) and market stalls selling non-essential goods.

But these businesses can continue to be able to operate click-and-collect (where goods are pre-ordered and collected off the premises) and delivery services.

Other businesses that must close in Tier 4 are:
• hospitality venues such as cafes, restaurants, pubs, bars and social clubs; with the exception of providing food and drink for takeaway (until 11pm), click-and-collect, drive-through or delivery
• accommodation such as hotels, hostels, guest houses and campsites, except for specific circumstances, such as where these act as someone’s main residence, where the person cannot return home, for providing accommodation or support to the homeless, or where it is essential to stay there for work purposes
• leisure and sports facilities such as leisure centres and indoor gyms, indoor swimming pools, indoor sports courts, indoor fitness and dance studios, indoor riding centres, and indoor climbing walls
• entertainment venues such as theatres, concert halls, cinemas, museums and galleries, casinos, amusement arcades, bingo halls, bowling alleys, skating rinks, go-karting venues, indoor play and soft play centres and areas (including inflatable parks and trampolining centres), circuses, fairgrounds, funfairs, zoos and other animal attractions, water parks and theme parks
