MARTIN Compston looks worlds away from his Line of Duty days after ITV revealed first-look images of him in their upcoming thriller Our House.

The broadcaster released eye-catching images for Our House earlier today - and Martin looks completely unrecognisable from his previous Steve Arnott role.

In Line of Duty, Martin was widely recognised for sporting a luscious full beard, forever synonymous with his straight-talking character.

However, for his new role in Our House, the 37-year-old has chosen to take a much smarter and cleaner approach, with his facial hair almost a thing of the past.

Downton Abbey actress Tuppence Middleton and Compston star as estranged wife Fiona and husband Bram.

Our House will revolve around Fiona, who is shocked when she returns home to discover that a stranger has moved into her house.

She believes that it is all one big misunderstanding.

But when she begins to look around the house, none of her possessions are there.

She is then left further devastated when she canâ€™t find her estranged husband.

The series then flashbacks in time to see scenes of Fi and her husband Bram together, before his hidden past is revealed.

The four-part drama will be based on the novel by the same name written by Louise Candlish.

The novel became a Sunday Times bestseller and won the Book of the Year - Crime and Thriller category at the British Book Awards in 2019.

Our House is coming soon to ITV and ITV Hub.
