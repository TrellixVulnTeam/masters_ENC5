Paying tribute to him, Alan’s brother, John, said on behalf of the family: “This was a huge shock to everyone. Our family are devastated that Alan has gone.

“He probably didn't know how much he would be missed. He was deep down a lovely person, but has struggled with life over time.

“To anyone over the years who was kind to my brother, I am eternally grateful.

“I pray he’s at peace. I want him to never be forgotten.”

At 6.41pm, police were called to reports that a silver Ford Focus had collided with the central reservation on the eastbound carriageway near Hangersley Hill.

The car then continued before stopping by the Rufus Stone services.

The driver then left the vehicle to cross to the westbound side of the carriageway where he collided with two cars.

Alan Bloomer, 27, was pronounced dead at the scene.

An inquest into Mr Bloomer's death has been opened, in which it was said that multiple injuries and a road traffic collision were the cause of death.

A full inquest is to be heard on August 10 this year.
