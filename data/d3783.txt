We are in the midst of a narrative shift, apparent in the about face we're seeing governments and corporate media take in the ever-present propaganda spew. What was unacceptable speech a month ago is now acceptable government and media talking points. What used to get you kicked off of social media are now BBC headlines.The question we address today is: why?
