California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) last month proposed a budget that would give all illegal aliens health coverage.

California lawmakers were weighing DOUBLING taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system that would cover all illegal aliens.

In 2019, California extended health coverage to illegals 26 and under.

In 2021, California began covering illegals over the age of 55.



The bill failed to pass the Democrat-controlled legislature on Monday so it is dead…for now.

A bill that would have created the nation’s only government-funded universal health care system died in the California Assembly on Monday as Democrats could not gather enough support to bring it for a vote ahead of a legislative deadline. The bill had to pass by midnight on Monday to have a chance at becoming law this year. Democrats needed 41 votes for that to happen, a threshold that did not seem impossible given that they control 56 of the 80 seats in the state Assembly and universal health care has long been a priority for the party. But intense lobbying from business groups put pressure on more moderate Democrats, who face tough reelection campaigns this year in newly-redrawn districts. Plus, Democrats were missing four lawmakers from their caucus — including three of their more liberal members — who had resigned recently to take other jobs. “Especially with four democratic vacancies in the Assembly, the votes were not there today, but we will not give up,” Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a Democrat from San Jose and the bill’s author, said in a news release.
