Your Eargos are ready to go right out of the box, but we’ll be there to help you adapt to using them.

We’ll pair you with your very own licensed hearing professional to help you make the most of your Eargos. They can tune your Eargos remotely and help answer any questions you have.

Get out there and start enjoying all the sounds you have been missing. Remember we offer lifetime Telecare support with your Eargo purchase. And with the Eargo smartphone app, you can make adjustments to your Eargos’ settings at your leisure.
