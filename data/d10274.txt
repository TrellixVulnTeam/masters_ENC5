Adams, too, said his party needs to take a broadly different approach to crime. While Democrats focus on long-term ideas like education and jobs, he said, they have a harder time addressing immediate needs like beefed-up policing. When those issues arise, “all of a sudden Democrats cringe, because you have to start now talking about how do you use police properly to get the justice we deserve and the safety we need,” Adams said.
