A BEER group beloved by ageing bearded blokes is going woke.

The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has launched a “diversity and inclusivity” survey to be less pale, male and stale.

It is trying to attract more women, gay people and those from ethnic minorities to the group, which has been sinking pints since 1971.

Now supporters, who until now have been mainly white middle-aged men, are being quizzed about their sexual orientation, ethnicity and the gender identity “assigned to you at birth”.

They are asked to share inclusivity and equality experiences and whether they think CAMRA is diverse enough.

Tory MP Bob Blackman said: “I’ve been a member of CAMRA since it started and I’m male, pale and grey. All sorts like drinking good beer.

“It is not a question of if you are male, female or black or white.”

His fellow Tory Mike Wood, chairman of Parliament’s pub group, said: “Like thousands of people across the country, I met my wife in a pub.

"A fussy image isn’t good. The more people reached out to and brought to the pub the better.”

CAMRA said: “We want everyone to feel welcome and safe.

"It is only by having a say that real change can be made.”
