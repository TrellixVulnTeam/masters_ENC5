The Death Toll in Australia From Fully Vaxxinated Is Growing to 8 Out of 10 People

Official figures: Covid-19 deaths are on the rise in Australia.

Australia is currently seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, but the unvaccinated population is not to blame, according to official New South Wales government figures.

Instead, Australia is experiencing the vaccinated pandemic very hard, with 9 out of every 10 cases and hospitalizations and 8 out of every 10 deaths between 26 Nov 21 and 8 Jan 22 reported in a triple/double vaccinated population.

On Dec 29, 21, only one Covid-19 death was reported in New South Wales, but as of Jan 17, 22, NSW recorded 36 Covid-19 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded to date. It is not the unvaccinated population that accounts for the record number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, but the fully vaccinated population.
