(WPBF) -- FORT PIERCE, Florida -- The church bells in a Fort Pierce neighborhood are ringing once again after a complaint from a neighbor prompted a response from St. Lucie County code enforcement.

Every day at noon and 6 p.m., the bells at Lakewood Park United Methodist Church ring for about 10 minutes at a time. The bells stopped for about a week and resumed on Saturday.

The church posted that a neighbor had complained that the church bells were bothering her, and county leaders said their code enforcement officers found the volume indeed was louder than the permitted decibel level.
