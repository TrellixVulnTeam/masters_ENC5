It looks like recruits don’t actually care about Brian Kelly’s dance moves.

The LSU football coach went mega-viral after Danny Lewis Jr. posted a recruiting video of him dancing with Kelly. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

The argument from LSU fans was that we couldn’t mock Kelly because recruits loved this stuff!

Unfortunately for LSU, Lewis didn’t love it enough because he committed Wednesday to play college football at Alabama.

I can’t tell you how many people told me that these dancing videos were genius and that Kelly was going to snag a bunch of recruits with them!

I was treated like I was the idiot because I didn’t buy into any of this nonsense.

Lewis was also clearly not sold on it because he decided to play for Nick Saban down in Tuscaloosa. It’s almost like winning national titles is more important than dancing videos.

Who could have ever guessed that? Who could have guessed players want to play for a coach with seven rings instead of one going viral.

Keep it up, Kelly! Please keep up these videos forever!
