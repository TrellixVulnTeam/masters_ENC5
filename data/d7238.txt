Fantasy Fund Manager is back for its sixth season – and with eight chances to win from our £15,000 prize pot, savvy stock picking has never been so important.

There is a £1,000 award for the best-performing fund each week, with £7,000 for the overall winner and £2,000 for the runner-up. The game is open to anyone, and players can already begin experimenting with up to two portfolios before the competition kicks off on Feb 14.

A great place to start for inspiration is the winning strategies of former champions.

Season four's winner, Jackson Read, got ahead by targeting companies that he thought would be bid for by American private equity firms.

The 25-year-old from Southend-on-Sea, who works for a hedge fund, turned £100,000 into £133,000, nearly 10 times the British stock market return, by buying British aerospace companies that were cheap relative to American peers.

When bids were announced, they shot up in value, such as a 30pc overnight leap for Ultra Electronics.

Another investor who knew the importance of owning takeover targets was season three winner Colin Riley, 51, from Stratford.

He decided on his strategy at the beginning of the game and did not tinker with it. He owned five healthcare companies throughout, choosing the sector because he hoped there would be some consolidation in the industry or a boost linked to coronavirus.

Bids were announced for Vectura Group and UDG Healthcare, sending their shares 33pc and 20pc higher. Because Mr Riley had a concentrated portfolio, this propelled his fund from £107,400 to £118,300, a 10pc return, in just one day in the final week.
