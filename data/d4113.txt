A longtime anchor for NBC Washington in the District of Columbia was charged with several misdemeanors following a car crash in Maryland over the past weekend, officials said.

Leon Harris was charged with a DUI and other counts following a crash on Jan. 29 in Montgomery County, Maryland, his station said in a report.

“Harris will not appear on-air as the investigation continues,” NBC Washington wrote in its article, adding that it “reached out to Harris for comment.”

Officials told the outlet that officers conducted a breathalyzer and found Harris’ result was twice the legal limit of 0.08 percent blood-alcohol content.

Authorities told FOX5 that Harris faces the following charges: driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol, driving a vehicle while so far impaired by drugs and alcohol cannot drive safely, an attempt by a driver to elude police in an official police vehicle by failing to stop, failure to return to and remain at the scene of an accident involving attended vehicle damage, failure to control vehicle speed on the highway to avoid a collision, and more.

Online court records show that it’s the second time Harris has been charged with a DUI in Montgomery County, which is located adjacent to Washington, WTOP reported. In 2013, he pleaded guilty after being pulled over on Interstate 270 near Route 28.

Harris, 60, joined the NBC affiliate station in 2017 from WJLA-TV. Prior to that, he worked at CNN in Atlanta for about 21 years.

It’s not clear if Harris has an attorney.
