I came to CNN on January 28, 2013. Together, we had nine great years. I certainly wish my tenure here had ended differently. But it was an amazing run. And I loved every minute.

I am grateful to the thousands of incredibly talented CNN and Turner Sports employees who helped make this such a joy for me, and a success for all of us.

I wish each of you nothing but the best in the years ahead.

With gratitude and much love.
