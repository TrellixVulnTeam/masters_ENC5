2020 has been quite a year and for many, online shopping and the thrill of the postman - one of the many hero key workers - arriving has been enough to get us through the Groundhog days.

We’ve also had to invest in a whole home work set-up - despite our initial reluctance. Desks, desk chairs and monitors have gone from luxury items to essentials as we’ve all needed to rethink our WFH situations as the months have gone on. The same goes for newly created home gyms complete with exercise bikes, dumbbells, resistance bands and everything we needed to stay in shape.

Spending more time at home than ever has also seen a huge surge in DIY and home improvement, whether it’s a gallery wall or a fully-fledge painting walls and an entire top to bottom revamp. Ditto loungewear, pyjamas and comfortable underwear as we’ve pushed our smart-casual attire to the back of our wardrobes.

There’s also been unexpected items at the top of our wish lists - wholesome pastimes won the lockdown game as we all were on the hunt for ways to reduce our screen time. We embraced our inner bakers with banana bread, sourdough and now cinnamon buns. To past the time - jigsaw puzzles, candle making, and new hobbies led the charge, while transport-wise, socially-distant wheeled options like bikes, electric bikes and scooters have accelerated in popularity.

They say what’s cheap is dear and when it comes to your back support, it’s worth forking out for. This chair from Herman Miller has scientific backing, created to help with your posture and spine with a tilt mechanism to keep you always in a natural position.

With both style and substance in spades, this fan heater has it all. It operates at a powerful 1800W output and constantly monitors the room's temperature. Alongside two settings, there’s also a tip over switch that will cut the power if the heater gets knocked over, which comes in handy with curious pets or adventurous toddlers around.

Make the cleaning process a breeze by introducing Dyson’s V11 hoover into your life. It comes with a whole host of attachments to suit just about every area of cleaning large or small with a spherical joint for greater manoeuvrability. There’s a super handy LCD display on the butt of the hoover, which counts down the minutes and seconds of battery life remaining.

Essential oil diffusers are the calming home addition we’ve all needed this year. The VicTsing has a natural wood design that gives Japandi feels. It has seven subtle light colour options, a 300ml capacity — ideal for large rooms — and comes with a timer for one to six hours. The material is BPA-free and the humidifier will power off automatically when it's short of water.

This option from MZ Skin has been developed by Dr Maryam Zamani – one of London’s go-to oculoplastic surgeons and aesthetic doctor. It has a chic, gold coloured LED mask that emits five different coloured lights to target a variety of skin issues. Each colour corresponds to a different concern; red is to strengthen and firm, blue is for decongesting skin and fighting breakouts, green to reduce the look of hyperpigmentation, yellow to sooth sensitive skin and white to promote healing.
