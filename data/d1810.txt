REAL MADRID legend Ronaldo is amazed by Kylian Mbappe's reported salary at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Real agreed an eyewatering £800,000-a-week deal with Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe on transfer deadline day.

According to Bild, the star striker has agreed terms on a deal worth a mind-boggling £41.6million per year with Los Blancos, who have been courting him for a long time.

The Brazil legend is stunned by the sum his former club is willing to splash for Mbappe, whose PSG contract expires in June.

Ronaldo told Bobo TV: "He is very strong, he has that speed and coldness in front of goal that will lead him to be number one.

"And I have read the news that he will go to Real Madrid and earn €50m a year….

"We have made the wrong generation [laughs]. The football industry is growing so much that it's only fair that the stars receive more and more money.

"If it's like that today, it's because there were players who inspired them, like we did."

However, Ronaldo doesn't consider Mbappe as the strongest centre-forward in the world right now.

Instead, the former Inter Milan star keeps Real's Karim Benzema and Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski in higher regard on that department.

The 45-year-old also believes Borussia Dortmund superstar Erling Haaland could become "number one" in the future.

Ronaldo added: "Benzema in my opinion, but Lewandowski is very close.

"Haaland will become very strong, maybe even number one, but he doesn't have the technique of the top two."
