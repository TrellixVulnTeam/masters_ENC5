Social media users have been left stunned by a hidden wheelchair lift at a luxury London hotel.

Queer disabled TikToker Alex Vásquez, who posts under @thewheelsblog, shared a video of the innovative design in action – which has wowed millions.

The five-star Kimpton Fitzroy London Hotel is based in Russell Square, Bloomsbury, and a standard double room costs around £300 a night.

The 19th-century building is considered a historic landmark and is Grade-II listed, so it’s only fitting the lift matches the design.

Alex’s video, posted with the caption ‘these London wheelchair lifts amaze me!’, shows him pointing as the stairs to the hotel retract back to reveal a platform.

Two metal sides roll up as he moves onto the platform, then the back of the lift rolls up behind him and the lift raises to the level of the hotel.

One TikTok user said: ‘Perfect way to expand access whilst protecting the integrity of the historic building!’

Another wrote: ‘Awesome. But I imagine so expensive.’

Someone else said: ‘That’s awesome! I sang at the Ballroom here at Christmas and used this entrance but had no idea it was wheelchair friendly!’

Other users debated whether it would be better to install a ramp – but several pointed out a ramp would likely be too steep here and would change the characteristics of the listed building.

Some disabled people said they much prefer the lift anyway as they struggle to use ramps, suggesting this version is more accessible.

Good work, London – it would be great to see more innovative and accessible devices like this.
