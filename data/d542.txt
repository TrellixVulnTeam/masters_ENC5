It is going to scrap meat, fish and deli counters in 317 stores and closes its Jack’s discount chain across the UK.

Tesco has said it will shut counters across 317 of its supermarkets where there has been the “lowest demand” for meat, fish and deli counters.

It is understood the move will impact hundreds of workers.

The retailer has not revealed the exact amount of jobs it will impact.

Tesco will shut seven of its 13 Jack’s discount stores which will impact on 130 jobs.

In 2018, the supermarket giant launched the discount store Jack’s to compete with retailers Lidl and Aldi

The six remaining outlets will become Tesco stores.

Tesco UK and Republic of Ireland chief executive Jason Tarry said: “Our Jack’s brand will continue to be sold across Booker and our symbol brands, bringing great value and quality to even more customers.

“We want to thank our Jack’s colleagues for all they have done and taught us.

“Our priority is to find roles within our wider business for all the colleagues who want to stay with us.”
