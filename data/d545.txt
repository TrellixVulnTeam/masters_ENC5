Before the revision, an electric scooter was classified as a mini-sized motorcycle, and those who ride them under the influence of alcohol could face up to a five-year prison term or 20 million-won fine. But the revised law labeled e-scooters as bicycles, thereby making them subject to a fine of only up to 30,000 won.
