Longleat safari park has welcomed a new addition to its koala clan at England's only koala colony.

The southern koala joey arrived into the world six months ago and is the first of its kind to be born in Europe.

Its mother Violet was brought to England from Australia over three years ago and has since been looked after by koala keepers.

In addition to milk, joeys eat 'pap' - a liquefied form of the mother's faeces which provides the baby with the microbes it needs to digest eucalyptus leaves.

The BBC's Environment Correspondent Jonah Fisher went to take a look.
