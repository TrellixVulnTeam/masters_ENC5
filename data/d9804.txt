He added that he would remain the local member of Parliament for his constituency, in an area to the east of Toronto.

Even before the vote on Mr. O’Toole’s leadership, some frustrated Conservative Party members of Parliament were already calling for his departure after he failed to defeat Mr. Trudeau’s Liberals when he fought his first federal election as Conservative Party leader in September. It was the Conservative Party’s third consecutive loss against Mr. Trudeau.

Mr. O’Toole, who was picked as leader less than two years ago, came to the election campaign as something of an unknown quantity among Canadians. He was elected as Conservative leader by appealing to the party’s right wing with a platform that promised to “take back Canada.”

Once installed as leader, however, he quickly tacked left and alienated many among the party’s conservative branch with his attempt to broaden the party’s appeal. After he failed to win last fall’s vote, Mr. O’Toole was criticized by Conservatives on the right for being a political clone of Mr. Trudeau, masquerading as a conservative.

Among other things, he abandoned a promise not to introduce a carbon tax and drew ire from some Conservative caucus members by abandoning a pledge to repeal Mr. Trudeau’s ban of about 1,500 models of military-style rifles.

He also sought to cast himself as a compassionate conservative, distancing himself from the party’s social conservatism on issues like L.G.B.T.Q. rights and abortion while reaching out to union members, a group that has traditionally supported the left-of-center New Democratic Party.

Ultimately, however, Mr. O’Toole’s repeated reversals on policy issues raised questions about exactly what he stood for, said Duane Bratt, a professor of political science at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta.
