A PLACE in the Sun presenter Jonnie Irwin has showcased his new “ugly” family home which is set for a mammoth transformation.

The property expert explained that he plans to get stuck in on the "massive project" over the next two months before he starts filming the hit Channel 4 property show again in April.

Appearing in a coat and hat, the host said: "Hello, from a rather chilly, but gorgeous day up here in Newcastle.

"You might remember that a short while ago I'd just posted that we'd bought a new family home.

"This is the first family home we've owned since we've been a family of five, so it's very exciting.”

The doting dad-of-three then exclaimed: "What a beauty," before adding: "Yeah, she's not the best, 1960s, but I intend to obviously make some changes but to embrace the 1960s of it.

"So, I want to make it modernist, I want to keep these straight lines. In my opinion, the 1960's was the first period we actually started to design houses for modern family life."

The star went on to reveal that he's in the process of finding out whether he needs planning permission before he starts making changes to his new home.

He added: "I want to document all that I do with this house and it will be warts and all, good news and bad news, including all my mistakes, of which there will be many, I'm sure.

"Well, it's a pretty lovely street, it's full of families and I've managed to find certainly the ugliest house."

A Place In The Sun airs weekdays on Channel 4 at 3pm.
