Need a TL;DR version? Don't worry, we got you! Basically, when an egg is released and isn't fertilized, the uterine lining sheds — which is the blood you see — and it's called a period, or menses. However, when you take birth control, an egg is not released, so the blood is actually caused by a drop in progesterone levels. In short, if you don't want to bleed on birth control, try to find one that gives you constant progesterone. Dr. Crawford says this can be the implant, shot, and sometimes the hormonal IUD, but talk to your doctor, who can help find the right one for you!
