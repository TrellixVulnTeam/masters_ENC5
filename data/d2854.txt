Aubameyang was pictured arriving in Barcelona on Monday lunchtime, when the clubs were in talks over a potential loan move, but as reports emerged that the deal had broken down it was suggested he had only been in the Spanish city to visit family.

However, the deal was revived late in the day as a permanent transfer, signalling the end of the forward’s Arsenal career.

Aubameyang was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy over a disciplinary breach last month and has not made a first-team appearance since, having been exiled by Mikel Arteta.

The club were keen to offload the Gabon international this month in order to make some saving on his astronomical £350,000-a-week wages and joining Barcelona allows the 32-year-old to continue his career at the highest level, having rejected interest from Saudi Arabia.

Arteta sanctioned Aubameyang’s departure in spite of the Gunners’ own shortage up-front.

Youngster Folarin Balogun has already gone on loan to Middlesbrough, leaving Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette as the only senior centre-forwards at the club - and both are due to be out of contract at the end of the season.

Serbian forward Dusan Vlahovic had been Arsenal’s main transfer target this month but he has left Fiorentina to join Juventus instead.

“We wish Auba all the best for the next chapter in his career and thank him for his contribution to the club,” Arsenal said as they confirmed the striker’s departure.
