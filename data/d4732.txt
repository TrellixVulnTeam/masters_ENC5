Romance is a glass of champagne at the edge of an infinity pool with your loved one as the sun sets. It's a seven-course tasting menu in a candle-lit dining room with white tablecloths and gleaming silverware after a soothing couples' massage. Or a day simply spent pottering about the thermal suites, half an hour in a Rhassoul mud chamber or even just a couple of hours relaxing by the pool, Ã  deux. In the UK, couples are spoilt for choice when it comes to luxury stays, with sprawling country house hotels complete with beautifully tended spa gardens, elegant town houses with ancient thermae waters tucked into the depths of the building, and lakeside lodges where one can watch the evening take over from the comfort of a private hot tub.

However you choose to spend time with your other half, whether it's a Valentine's Day treat, a special occasion or one of those rare weekends that you're both free, here's our guide to the most romantic spa breaks for couples in the UK, featuring the top places to stay for massages, couples' spa suites, hot tubs, hammams, saunas, steam rooms and swimming pools, along with Michelin-starred restaurants and luxurious rooms.
