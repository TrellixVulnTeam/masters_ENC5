A drug dealing suspect ‘with a knife’ was arrested in Worcestershire as part of a county lines investigation.

The 29-year-old man was arrested in Woodrow, Redditch on Wednesday (December 30) by officers from North Worcestershire’s County Lines team, who were in the area in response to concerns raised around drug dealing.

The man was found to be carrying a knife and a quantity of what is believed to be Class A drugs, both of which were seized by police.

Detective Inspector Gerry Smith from West Mercia Police said: “The associated harm with county lines such as criminal exploitation, cuckooing and street violence is far-reaching and we will not stop in our efforts to relentlessly pursue those involved.”

The arrest is part of West Mercia Police’s Protect campaign, aimed at tackling serious and organised crime together with partner agencies.

The 29-year-old suspect from Birmingham has been released pending further enquiries.

Class A drugs can be cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, LSD, magic mushrooms, methadone or crystal meth.

Anyone found to be supplying Class A drugs can be jailed for life and face an unlimited fine. Possession of Class A drugs carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail or an unlimited fine.
