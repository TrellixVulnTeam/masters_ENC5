A PLANNING application to convert a former Kidderminster betting shop into new apartments has been given the green light.

The old William Hill betting office is set to be transformed into three one-bedroom flats, which will support housing demand and enhance the appearance of the street scene, according to developers.

The site is located at Bull Ring in the town centre and upper floors were previously converted into apartments. The building sits next to the Grade II listed Medical Hall, with plans also lodged to convert its offices into flats.
