Well, I think he was driven.

A lot of those quarterbacks are. There's no doubt about that. He was completely invested. I think, as his career went along, he was enjoying it maybe more than ever toward the end. And I think he was driven by this — by whatever it was inside of him to keep it going, to never let people down, in particular, his teammates, to try to get better.

And coaches are always saying and players are always saying, we're trying to get better. And a lot of times, it's pretty much empty talk. They're trying to get better, but they're doing other things as well. With Brady, he truly was trying to get better. He understood every aspect of the game inside out. He was matched up with a great coach, obviously, in Bill Belichick.

And I think that Tom, having obviously some fine physical skills — but plenty of quarterbacks do — and maybe he was just a touch above in his dedication to the game, the dedication to his craft, the way he took care of his body, and, obviously, the way he performed.
