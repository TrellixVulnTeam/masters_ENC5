There’s so much going on in the world and so much that many of us are waiting on. But who do you believe? Is it as Q stated, just a show? Are we waiting on the military or is change up to us?

Here are a few of the recent headlines:

Who Has Left Spotify So Far? Neil Young Leads Artist Exodus Over Joe Rogan

And this is just the past few days! We know you’ll have more to discuss and the talks are always stimulating.

Join us this Thursday to talk about what’s happening in your area of the world. Share your thoughts on possible fake news or false flag events and the real news that matters most. Time zone converter for your convenience is here.

Ben Visser & Kat Carroll will host in Melissa’s absense this week. If you would like to attend and need the zoom link, please send an email to [email protected]. For our regulars, please check zulip for the latest link as the old one expired.

Whether you are new to our group or a regular, we ask that you read the guidlines below as they have been updated.

To maintain a smooth, distraction-free Zoom call, we ask that you familiarize yourself with the Zoom platform. If this is your first time on Zoom, don’t worry. We were all new at one time and we can walk you through the basics.
• Please mute your mic upon entering the room. This helps eliminate background noise, feedback, or other distortions that can disrupt the flow of communication. Please keep your mic muted until your turn to speak. If able, please have your video on.
• If you have a concern or find yourself emotionally triggered by something stated, please type a note in the chat box and a volunteer will assist you by opening a breakout room. This creates a separate safe space for you and a volunteer to talk in private.
• Questions/comments pertaining to the topic of discussion should be verbalized and not placed in the chat as it can be quite distracting for the guest speaker and host. When verbalized, everyone benefits! If you would like to contribute to the discussion, please raise your hand or use the raise hand button in the app. Please lower your hand once you’ve spoken or as soon as you are acknowledged to speak. If your hand has been raised and you still have not been acknowledged, please mention this in the chat so a volunteer may assist.
• Please limit your comments/shares to about 2 to 3 minutes maximum so everybody may have the opportunity to contribute to the discussion. Mute your mic when finished speaking.
• Be respectful in your communications: Do not interrupt others who are speaking and please, do not use foul language. You are a representative of PFC and should act accordingly. Use the zoom reaction buttons to raise your hand, react to a comment, to support a speaker, or vote. Please, do not speak until your name is called AND do not speak over others who have been acknowledged to talk.

Prepare for Change strives to protect the privacy and security of all participants in our zoom calls. Most of our conversations are not recorded. However, from time to time, we may have a guest speaker or a topic that we wish to record and post on the site for the benefit of our members. You will always be notified in advance of such an event. If you do not wish to be recorded on the zoom call, simply turn off your video. You also have the option to change your name as it appears on screen or to use only a first name.

We look forward to seeing your there!
