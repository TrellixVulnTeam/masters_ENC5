One of the most accurate pollsters of the last 20 years released a bombshell poll Monday that shows 50 percent of voters want to see His Fraudulency Joe Biden impeached. Only 45 percent say they disagree.

This includes 50 percent of black voters who want to see Biden impeached.

“Half of voters believe President Joe Biden should be impeached, and nearly as many think Republicans will do it if they win a congressional majority in the midterm elections,” says Rasmussen Reports.

“A new national telephone and online survey by Rasmussen Reports and The National Pulse finds that 50% of Likely U.S. voters support the impeachment of Biden, including 33% who Strongly Support it.”

Rasmussen adds, “Forty-five percent (45%) are opposed to impeaching Biden, including 33% who Strongly Oppose it.”

Are you ready for this…? Thirty-four (34 percent) of Democrats support impeaching Biden, as do 50 percent (not a typo) of black voters.
