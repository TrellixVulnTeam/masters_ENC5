Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) is the key enzyme for the virus gene replication and the most important target for antiviral therapy. Toxicity, drug resistance and side effects have led to search for new antiviral agents. Farnesiferol C (FC) is a well-known biologically active sesquiterpene coumarin derivative from genus Ferula. The current study was designed to examine the impacts of FC on the structure and function of HIV-1 RT, using some theoretical and experimental methods. FC inhibited HIV-1RT activity via mixed inhibition mechanism (IC = 30 Î¼M). Spectroscopic data showed some conformational changes in the secondary as well as tertiary structure of HIV-1RT following the interaction with FC. Results showed that FC could quench the intrinsic fluorescence emission of HIV-1RT through static quenching mechanism. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that hydrogen bondings and van der Waals forces are the major forces in the binding reaction and the low equilibrium constants (K) value obtained from surface plasmon resonance data, confirmed the high affinity of FC for HIV-1RT. Molecular docking studies indicated that FC interacts with enzyme through hydrophobic pocket. Taken together, the outcomes of this research revealed that, sesquiterpene coumarines can be used to design natural remedies as anti-HIV agents.
