I never set out to become a middle-aged woman known for jazzy eyewear but that’s exactly who I am.

Like many 40- and 50-something people, I have presbyopia, a condition that makes it difficult to see what’s right in front of me. Words and people look a little bit smudged around the edges, sometimes to a dizzying degree, like a watercolor painted with a sodden brush.

Now, in addition to the contact lenses I’ve worn since sixth grade to correct nearsightedness, I wear reading glasses to keep the close-up world crisp. I own a dozen pairs in all shapes and sizes, with a bias toward big frames in primary colors — think Sally Jessy Raphael, Carrie Donovan and Iris Apfel. I stash glasses in my desk drawer, sock drawer and junk drawer, at the bottom of my bag and in my car, between couch cushions and under a pile of mail, on my bedside table and on top of my head. Still, I can never find a pair when I need one, and I’m never sure what strength I need. It depends on the brand, the quality of the lenses and the brightness of the room where I’m sitting. I read for a living — I’m an editor at The New York Times Book Review — so I need to be able to see words on a page! Clearly!

At 38, wearing reading glasses was a fun way to express my individuality and free-spiritedness (or to summon the free spirit I wish I had). At 48, I’ve become so dependent on them, they’ve lost some appeal. I constantly miss texts and emails because I’m on the go and can’t see my phone. Yes, I’ve increased the font size, but sometimes I don’t want my kids to be able to read my screen from across the room.

So when I heard about Vuity, a new type of eye drop for people with age-related blurred vision, I was eager to give it a try. From an article in the Times, I learned that “a single Vuity drop in each eye improved trial subjects’ close-range vision for six hours and improved their intermediate vision — important for computer work — for 10 hours,” though each person’s experience will vary.
