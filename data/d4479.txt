A gunman fatally shot a police officer and a campus safety officer at Bridgewater College in Virginia on Tuesday afternoon, the authorities said.

The assailant, who fled after the 1:20 p.m. shooting, was captured at 1:55 p.m. after a “massive search operation” involving local, state and federal law enforcement officials, the college said in a statement.

Pictures from the scene show him being detained near a riverbank.

In an email sent at 5:04 p.m. to the students and faculty, David Bushman, the president of the college, said that the two officers had been killed.

He identified the victims as John Painter, the police officer, and J.J. Jefferson, the campus safety officer. They were often referred to as the “dynamic duo,” Mr. Bushman said. “John was J.J.’s best man in his wedding this year,” he added.
