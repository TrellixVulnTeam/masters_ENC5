Celebrating February 14 can be a divisive thing; some reject the notion of making an effort on a single day, but we say why not use the day as an opportunity to go above and beyond?

Of all the holidays, it can feel like Valentine’s is engineered solely towards women, what with the abundance of bouquets, lingerie and beautifully decorated boxes of chocolate. In fact there are so many female-centred options around that Google has found searches for men’s gifts are actually higher and outnumber searches “for women” by 3.5 to 1.

Top line: shopping for men can be hard.

To that end, we’ve whipped up the last Valentine’s Day gift guide for men you’ll ever need. From new fragrances that will finally kick that decades-old Old Spice to the curb to generous hampers that will leave him stuffed full of love and plenty more besides, we’ve got lots of brilliant ideas guaranteed to have him beaming this February.
