Lawmakers in Concord Hampshire are proposing a bill that will allow pharmacists to dispense Ivermectin by means of standing orders.

“Standing order” means a written and signed protocol authored by one or more physicians licensed under RSA 329:12 or one or more advanced practice registered nurses licensed under RSA 326-B:18, the bill stated.

The bill is now in committee but is expected to go to a House vote in the coming weeks, WMUR reported.

New Hampshire residents may soon be able to receive ivermectin from pharmacies without first getting a prescription or approval from a doctor. Proposed legislation titled House Bill 1022 would allow pharmacists to dispense the drug, which some believe can treat COVID-19 even though it lacks approval for such use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), by means of standing orders. Under the law, pharmacists would be able to “dispense ivermectin under the delegated prescriptive authority of the physician or APRN (Advanced Practice Registered Nurses), specify a mechanism to document screening performed and the prescription in the patient’s medical record, and include a plan for evaluating and treating adverse events,” according to the bill. “Any such prescription shall be regarded as being issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice.”
