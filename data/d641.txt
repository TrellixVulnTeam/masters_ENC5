These were the deserted scenes as Tamworth and the whole of Staffordshire officially entered Tier 4 this morning.

The Government announced yesterday that due to the rise in Covid-19 cases the county will be joining a host of others in moving up from three to four.

And on New Year's Eve our streets were barely populated at all. Our photos and video show people sticking to the new rules and guidance issued by the Government.

Tamworth’s Covid lead Jeremy Oates said: “This is pretty much as close to a national lockdown as we can get but on a regional level. Don’t go out, stay at home, protect yourself and everyone else.

“It is disappointing because I think we were on the cusp but the difficulty is it is about hospital capacity as well as other measures and and hospital capacity is always a week behind case rates. If someone tests positive today then the likelihood is it would be a week before they were to be in hospital. I do think it is about that side of it rather than our infection rate.

“Cases are going up and have been for the last few weeks but we are not escalating in the same way London is. No Tamworth wards fall into the top 20 per cent in Staffordshire for case rates and there are no hotspots proposed for Tamworth which is good news.

"At the end of November and start of December we had a bit of a lull and got really low so hopefully this will bring it down again and we can review again pretty quickly.

“It is a testing and trying time for many businesses at the moment. I genuinely feel for them and their staff because it is another kick just as we go into the New Year.

“With two vaccines available and now tier 4 I think we are going to start to see some rapid changes over the next sort of three months, certainly by the summer I would hope to be in a much better place and we can start rebuilding.”

Tamworth’s MP Christopher Pincher said: “I am of course disappointed to see Staffordshire move into Tier 4 along with over 75 per cent of the country. This new Covid strain is incredibly virulent and easily travels from person to person.

“This is why we are seeing case rates rocketing across the country. In Tamworth, in the seven days before Christmas, the number of cases grew by over 20 per cent, and in Lichfield it was by over 50 per cent. Seven days is a very short amount of time for such a big increase. If we wait for even a short time more the number of infections could run out of control.

“Admissions into hospitals are rising fast, and across the United Kingdom we currently have nearly 22,000 people in hospital with this dreadful virus.

“I have continued to meet the Health Secretary each week to go through the data in Tamworth and Staffordshire, as well as with the Vaccines Minister to see how we can ensure Tamworth is getting all the vaccines we need.

“The new vaccines are important, they will be our passport to freedom and our passport to recovery. Only this morning we got the excellent news that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine had been approved in the United Kingdom.

“We have an order large enough for 50 million people and unlike the Pfizer vaccine out new British vaccine does not need super cold temperatures to be stored in. We can be proud of British science and look forward to it putting a stop to this virus.

“Please continue to do your bit; stay home, keep washing those hands and control the virus.”

· You must not meet indoors socially with any other household, unless part of your support bubble

· All shops deemed non-essential by the Government must close
