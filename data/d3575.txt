Norfolk, Va. – To help heat things up in the bedroom and ensure that this Valentine’s Day is fulfilling in every way, PETA is now offering its first-ever Hot & Heavy Gift Box, available for preorder here. The box, which was inspired by PETA’s viral NSFW pro-fruit video, contains edible massage oil and a variety of mood-enhancing foods: oranges to increase blood flow to all the vital organs, avocados for increased stamina, strawberries with loads of libido-boosting zinc, and chili peppers to spice things up.

“Indulging in vibrant vegan foods can lead to a more fruitful love life on Valentine’s Day and every other day,” says PETA President Ingrid Newkirk. “PETA encourages loving people to treat themselves to this gift box and revel in the bedroom benefits that going vegan delivers.”

PETA—whose motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to eat”—notes that a whopping 67% of people report a boost in bedroom performance after going vegan, which is just another reason to spare animals miserable lives of confinement and terrifying final moments in slaughterhouses. Everyone who goes vegan saves the lives of nearly 200 individuals each year—and becomes a more intriguing romantic prospect.

PETA opposes speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview. For more information on PETA’s investigative newsgathering and reporting, please visit or follow the group on , , or .
