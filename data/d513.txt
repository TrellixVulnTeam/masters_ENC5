For weeks, they have told us the election machines are NOT connected to the Internet.

It’s not even possible, they say!

Except…..it was proven in the general election and now Jovan Pulitzer who is doing Pulitzer-quality type work just proved it again by hacking into one of the machines that is slated to be used in the upcoming GA runoff election.

Oh, and this is highly illegal, but don’t mind that.

My friends at The Gateway Pundit had more details:

Inventor Jovan Hutton Pulitzer was in front of the Georgia Senate today and he totally destroyed Georgia’s 2020 election results. Jovan Pulitzer on Wednesday told Georgia lawmakers he hacked into Dominion voting systems at a Georgia polling place. Advertisement – story continues below

 Pulitzer confirmed that the Georgia runoff IS connected to the internet. He established a two-way communication from a polling pad in a voting center. “At this very moment at a polling location in the county, not only do we have access through the devices to the poll pad–the system, but WE ARE IN,” Pulitzer said. He continued, “And it’s not supposed to have WiFi and that’s not supposed to be able to happen so we’ve documented now it’s communicating two ways in real time, meaning it’s receiving data and sending data — should never happen, shouldn’t be WiFi, we’ve now documented it in real time. “That’s going on right there where everyone is voting [in the Georgia runoff].”
