Every cafe and restaurant tries to attract customers and keep them satisfied. They use unusual decorations, exotic menus, and creative meals. But there’s always a risk of trying too hard and overdoing it. And this is what happened to the people from this article.

We at Bright Side had a good laugh and sympathized with Internet users that went to such unique restaurants.

“I have a sinking feeling about this quesadilla.”

“The sushi place we went to served us on a skateboard.”

“The sauce was dripping from the holes.”

“The juices dripped onto my legs through that nice crack in the board.”

“I remembered how we were served a pork sandwich in Spain.”

“I was served a drink. Yes, these are actual worms.”

“My friend was craving nachos and they came in a dog bowl...”

“The kid’s meal was served in a hat. The 7-year-old recipient states, ’Yeah, this is kinda weird, dad....’”

“Not sure whether to eat it or launch it!”
