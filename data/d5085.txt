Majority of Americans want Biden to consider ‘all possible nominees’

A new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds that a plurality of Americans view the Supreme Court as motivated by partisanship, while Joe Biden’s campaign trail vow to select a black woman to fill a high-court vacancy without reviewing all potential candidates evokes a sharply negative reaction from voters.

Only a little more than 1 in 4 nonwhite Americans (28%) wish for Biden to consider only Black women for the vacancy. Democrats are more supportive of Biden’s vow (46%) than Americans as a whole, but still a majority of Democrats (54%) also prefer that Biden consider all possible nominees.
