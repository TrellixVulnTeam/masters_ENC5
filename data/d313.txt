The catchy tune, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, knocked Adele's "Easy On Me" out of the top spot and became the first Disney song to reach the pinnacle of the chart since "A Whole New World" from "Aladdin" in 1993.

The Oscar-winning song "Let It Go" from Disney's "Frozen" peaked at No. 5 on the chart in 2014.

"We Don't Talk About Bruno" has had more than 34 million streams, according to Billboard.

"Encanto" is directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard and premiered in the fall. The film features the voices of Stephanie Beatriz, Maria Cecilia Botero, John Leguizamo, Mauro Castillo, Jessica Darrow, Angie Cepeda, Carolina Gaitan, Diane Guerrero and Wilmer Valderrama.
