A former Manchester United teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo has described the Portuguese's return to Old Trafford as a failure so far.

Kleberson joined in the same summer Ronaldo made the switch to Manchester, with both signings being announced together and he spent two years playing alongside him.

The Brazilian was expecting big things when United brought him back to the club this summer from Juventus.

But since the shock transfer, the legendary attacker has had a frustrating time.

Although his personal stats look impressive, with 14 goals and three assists in 23 games, it's been a difficult season for United.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November after two embarrassing defeats to Liverpool and Watford, while the club have failed to be involved in the title race - currently battling for fourth place.

Kleberson has said that his former club may have made a mistake in bringing him back.

He said to the Daily Star: "To be honest, the Ronaldo experiment has been a bit of a failure so far - especially because of the level of player he is and how of late he has impacted the team.

"When you look at the things he can bring to the club and what he brings to the fans, it’s not been amazing.

“The current United team haven’t played well together of late.

"It’s a tough time for Ronaldo to have returned to the club. Both him and United have a huge history together.

“Players like Ronaldo come back to a club after time away and it’s a totally different style of play and atmosphere to what they remember before. The club isn’t the same as under Sir Alex Ferguson and it must be challenging for him to comprehend that."

Ronaldo signed a two-year deal with United with an option of a third at the end of his contract.

Ralf Rangnick took over from Solskjaer in November and he'll help appoint a new manager in the summer as United look to rebuild their squad.
