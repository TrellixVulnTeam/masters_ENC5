The road will become known as La Rose Lane taking the name of the poet and activist John La Rose who founded the first Caribbean publishing company in Britain.

The council said the switch was part of a wider review of monument, buildings, place and street names.

It was “aimed at ensuring that our public spaces across Haringey are reflective and respectful of our wonderfully rich and diverse borough”.

Leader of Haringey Council Peray Ahmet said: “As part of our commitments to tackling systematic inequalities and responding to the Black Lives Matter movement we will work alongside residents, and stakeholders to celebrate our diversity through commemoration, public artworks, education and more.

“A road name change is only a small aspect of the bigger picture in our fight against inequality.”

The council said postcodes and house numbers would not be affected by the change and the Royal Mail would be automatically updated.

The National Address database would also be changed.

Cllr Mike Hakata, Cabinet Member for Environment, Transport and the Climate Emergency and Deputy Leader of the Council, said: “The council is undertaking a strategic review of how we pay tribute to historic figures through monuments, buildings, places and street names. In a borough that celebrates its uniquely rich cultural heritage and diverse population this is a necessity.

“Ahead of any report from this review we have agreed to rename Black Boy Lane to La Rose Lane. Regardless of questions over timing or the origins of the name this is an important step. However, changing the name of a street does not change the structures of inequality or the fortunes of everyone who is caught on the wrong side of prejudice.

“As a local black councillor, I must ask, have we done enough? Have we invested enough? The answer is simple - we need to do more, invest more, and with urgency, in collaboration with the black population of our borough whose lives matter not only in name but in action.”
