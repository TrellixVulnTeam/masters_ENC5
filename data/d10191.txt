KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) â€” A winter storm dropped several inches of snow over much of Kansas and parts of Missouri on Wednesday and forecasters are expecting more snow overnight into Thursday.

The National Weather Service said that Columbia received about 5 inches (12.70 centimeters) of snow and Jefferson City had 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) before the snow tapered off after noon. The St. Louis and Kansas City areas were generally reporting 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) to 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) of snow.

The weather services said many areas had breaks in the snow in the afternoon before precipitation begins again and some regions could see 7 inches (17.78 centimeters) to 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) before snow moves out Thursday.

Areas around Wichita had reported up to 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) of snow and another 2 inches were possible through the evening, forecasters said. Topeka reported nearly 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) with many other areas reported lesser amounts. Augusta, in Butler County, recorded 8.5 inches (21.59 centimeters).

Temperatures are forecast to fall below zero overnight with dangerous wind chills. Freezing temperatures are forecast to last through Thursday, meaning roads will freeze again and make driving treacherous.
