VICTORIA Beckham is a very disciplined eater who “pokes the food around her plate”, according to Gyles Brandreth.

The former MP shed more light on the Spice Girls’ eating habits after her husband David Beckham revealed she has eaten the same meal for the last 25 years – grilled fish and steamed vegetables.

Chatting on This Morning today, Gyles – who says he had dinner with the Beckhams at a charity event – defended her food choice and insisted she does actually mix it up by eating different types of white fish.

He said: “I have sat at a table with them and there he is the steak and fries and all the rest of it, tucking in and there she is, not just with fish and steamed veg, it’s a tiny bit of fish and steamed vegetables, sort of poking them around the plate.

“She is not wolfing them down, she has just disciplined herself.

“And the fish does vary from meal to meal, it’s not always the same fish and the steamed vegetables vary from meal to meal.”

The Gogglebox star added: “I have witnessed it and I have seen how wonderful she looks and how healthy she is.”

His comments come after David, 46, said he loves sharing his food but the former Spice Girl, 47, will only ever have the same thing, admitting the one time she did try something else was “one of his favourite evenings.”

Discussing his wife’s diet on the River Cafe Table 4 podcast, he explained: “I get quite emotional about food and wine, when I’m eating something great I want everyone to try it.

“Unfortunately I’m married to someone that has eaten the same thing for the last 25 years.

“Since I met her she only eats grilled fish, steamed vegetables, she will very rarely deviate from that.”

He continued: “The only time she’s probably ever shared something that’s been on my plate was actually when she was pregnant with Harper and it was the most amazing thing. It was one of my favourite evenings. I can’t remember what it was but I know she’s not eaten it since.”
