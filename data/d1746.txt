Pierre Emerick Aubameyang completed his free transfer to Barcelona after an extraordinary few hours of deadline day negotiations, writes MARK IRWIN.

A proposed loan move to the Nou Camp was on the brink of collapse when Arsenal threatened to pull the plug on negotiations.

But just when it looked as though the striker would be forced to return to London with his tail between his legs, the two clubs struck a remarkable compromise just three hours before the transfer window closed.

So instead of joining the Spanish giants on loan for the rest of the season, he has now severed all ties with Arsenal and will not be returning to the Emirates.

It means Arsenal will save themselves £26million in the wages which Aubameyang was due over the remaining 18 months of his contract.

But they have also written off a player who cost them £60million when he joined from Borussia Dortmund exactly four years earlier.

It is understood that Aubameyang has taken a massive pay cut to sign for Barcelona, who are operating under strict FFP regulations after reporting a £1.6billion financial loss last year.

The 32-year-old striker took a massive gamble when he made the bold decision to fly to Spain yesterday morning while the two clubs were still miles apart in negotiations.
