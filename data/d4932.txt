JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — An 11th pediatric coronavirus death in Mississippi was confirmed Tuesday by state health officials.

The Mississippi State Department of Health said none of the patients who died had been vaccinated.

Since the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Mississippi in March 2020, the department has reported:

— one death in an infant – under one year of age

“Vaccination is the best protection for our children who are eligible to receive it. For those under 5 years of age, it is critically important that everyone around the infant or child are vaccinated," Byers said.

The state currently reports 7% of those in the 5-11 age group as fully vaccinated and 37% of the 12-17 age group.

In addition to vaccinations, the state encouraged families to continue social distancing, wearing masks and avoiding large crowds.
