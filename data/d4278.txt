Sue Gray’s report into partygate revealed police are investigating at least three gatherings where the prime minister was in attendance.

In total the Met is looking into 12 parties and examining around 300 photographs as part of the investigation.

Before the u-turn, Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner had said: “The public have a right to know if the prime minister is found to have committed an offence by the police.

“Boris Johnson said he would publish the full report of the investigation conducted by Sue Gray into his behaviour. He cannot be allowed to backtrack or hide the results of the police investigation.”

Johnson’s position as party leader has been hanging in the balance amid anger on his backbenches at both the parties and his handling of the revelations. His position appears to be secure for now following a meeting with Tory MPs and peers on Monday night and his promise to make major changes to his Downing Street operation. But in a sign of the continued unhappiness on the Conservative benches, another Tory MP, Peter Aldous, announced this afternoon that he wanted Johnson to step down.
