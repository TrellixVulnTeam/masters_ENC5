The NHS is 'well and truly in the eye of the storm' in terms of dealing with coronavirus, a Wolverhampton hospital boss said.

Across the country 21,000 inpatients are battling Covid-19, which is "putting real pressure on" the healthcare service.

Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals chief, Prof David Loughton, said while the West Midlands wasn't experiencing case numbers like the South East and London, it was important to "do everything we can to stop numbers climbing".

Speaking at West Midlands Combined Authority media briefing on Thursday morning, he continued: "I can only speak for my organisation, but I have seen the worst ambulance turnaround times I've ever seen in last couple of weeks.

"This is because we're not doing what we normally do.

"We have a winter surge plan as we expect to be busy in January and early February and part of that includes putting nurses in corridors in A&E - it's not the right thing to do but it's the way we get through and nurse people in corridors to let ambulances get back on the road.

"We can't do that this year because it is unsafe to put patients on corridors as we don't know who is covid positive or negative at that stage, we test every patient but it takes time to get results back."

He said while all patients were getting treated, it was important to stop admissions rising, adding: "It is a very difficult situation."

He said he was waiting for figures later today to show the impact of Christmas gatherings but hoped everyone would please "do what you can to protect the NHS and save lives."
