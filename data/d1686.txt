They included Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat who traditionally represents Manhattan’s East Side; and whichever Democrat runs against Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican whose district includes Staten Island and a swath of South Brooklyn.

“Shapes can be deceptive,” said Richard Briffault, a law professor who studies gerrymandering at Columbia University, which falls inside Mr. Nadler’s district. “A district may look strangely shaped, but it may be a way of holding together people with a similar economic background or ethnic backgrounds.”

Mr. Briffault said that mapmakers — whether politicians, independent commissions or the courts — are always trying to balance competing imperatives that go well beyond geography. Districts should be as compact as possible, and they must be contiguous. But communities with common interests should be kept whole to maintain their voice, especially racial minorities.

In a state like New York, where politicians from a single party control the process, they will also try to eke out as much partisan political gain as they can.

So it is in Mr. Nadler’s new district.

Its broad outlines — stretching from the Upper West Side to Borough Park — have been in place for decades. In 2012, a nonpartisan court-appointed special master gave her stamp of approval.

While it will soon include a huge range of economic and racial groups, including Chinese populations in Manhattan’s Chinatown and Brooklyn’s Sunset Park, mapmakers have long used the district to unite some of the city’s most robust Jewish communities rooted on the Upper West Side and in Brooklyn’s Borough Park neighborhood. No district in the country has more Jewish voters, and Mr. Nadler, who was educated in a yeshiva, is the last remaining Jewish House member from New York City.

And Jewish leaders have repeatedly given public testimony over the years calling for the two areas to remain stitched together.
