To read “Vladimir” (or any number of campus novels published in the past decade), you’d have to conclude that teaching humanities at the college level is pure hell. A person spends years in training only to land — if she’s lucky! — toiling for peanuts in a place where she never intended to live, drowning in administrative duties and serving at the pleasure of entitled and fickle students. To quote Peggy Lee: Is that all there is?

The thesis of Lee’s 1969 hit can be summarized as: Life is an unbroken series of disenchanting events, and the best solution is to “break out the booze and have a ball” with your friends. The unnamed narrator of Julia May Jonas’s debut novel, a 58-year-old literature professor at a college in upstate New York, adopts this philosophy of living.

We meet the narrator at a tough juncture. Her husband, John, is the chair of the school’s English department, and he’s in hot water for having relationships with students — relationships that occurred in the past, before the school explicitly banned such interactions, but details of which have recently surfaced and culminated in a petition signed by more than 300 people calling for his removal.

The narrator doesn’t care much about John’s dalliances. He’s more of a roommate than a husband, and the two have always had an agreement in which extramarital flings are tacitly permitted. What infuriates her are the women who have come forward. “I wish they could see themselves not as little leaves swirled around by the wind of a world that does not belong to them, but as powerful, sexual women interested in engaging in a little bit of danger, a little bit of taboo, a little bit of fun.” She finds their “post hoc prudery” nauseating.
