THE Bachelor fans slammed Clayton Echard for not eliminating "villain" Shanae Ankney following her ongoing drama in the group.

Episode four of the ABC reality series showed the Bachelor in a tough spot as he was put in the middle of the "shrimp-gate" feud between Shanae and her rival, Elizabeth Corrigan.

Shanae claimed that Elizabeth "bullied" her with shrimp - something she denied - and the blondes continued to battle over the seafood for several minutes.

Elizabeth was accused of "ignoring" Shanae with a plate of shrimp back in the jacuzzi at the Bachelor mansion - which viewers ripped as "ridiculous" drama.

A frustrated Clayton had to excuse himself from their screaming as it had gotten so extreme and was left with a decision - which one of the contestants to keep.

Ultimately, he sent Elizabeth home at the rose ceremony and kept Shanae - which fans slammed as a "dumb and delusional" move.

Missouri native Clayton was introduced to Bachelor Nation in Michelle Young's season of the Bachelorette which began airing in October 2021.
