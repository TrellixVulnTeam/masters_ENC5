“I think it’s highly likely that the next phase will involve death on a scale which will dwarf the claims of “covid-19 deaths” to date.” Dr. Mike Yeadon, former Pfizer Vice President.

Question– Why was mortality in Scotland higher in 2021 than 2020?

Answer– Because more people were dying. And the reason more people were dying is because more people had been vaccinated. In other words, there’s a link between rising mortality and the Covid-19 vaccine.

Answer– You’re right, I can’t. The evidence is all circumstantial. But it is compelling, all the same. For example, rising mortality hasn’t just happened in Scotland. It’s happened in many of the countries that launched mass vaccination campaigns in early 2021. They’ve all seen a significant uptick in all-cause mortality. Why is that? What did they do differently in 2021 than they did in the years before?

Question– I can see what you’re getting at, but I still don’t think you have enough evidence to make your case.

Answer– Okay, then you tell me: Why did more people die in 2021 than 2020? And, keep in mind, all-cause mortality isn’t just up a bit; it smashed the five-year average. Check out this post from Alex Berenson at Substack:
