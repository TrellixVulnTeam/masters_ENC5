“Our groundhogs, named Archie, Nagini and Sarah – have ignored their ‘official holiday’ as is customary and did not wake up. That’s because 2 February and Groundhog Day is celebrated in the US and a number of other countries where the average weather is already much higher than ours by this time. Furthermore, two different kinds of groundhogs live in Russia and the United States. The American groundhog is a forest marmot, while Russia’s is a steppe marmot. Ours is characterised by a longer hibernation period, which lasts between three and six months,” the Zoo explained in a press statement.
