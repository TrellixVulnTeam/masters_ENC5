Watford are sat in the bottom three after losing their last game to Norwich, which spelled the end of Claudio Ranieri.

Hodgson has since been appointed and the 74-year-old believes he can keep the Hornets up, after doing the same with Crystal Palace, Fulham and West Brom.

“I think it is more than possible,” he said.

“I wouldn’t have accepted the challenge had I not believed we can help out and help the club to stay in the Premier League.

“In that respect I am quite confident that the work we do will have an affect.

“But of course the proof of the pudding is always going to be in the eating and it’s going to be very important that the players react well to what we are asking them to do, and most importantly that they can produce the level of performances that are going to be necessary.

“This particular league, in terms of relegation, is a dogfight.”
