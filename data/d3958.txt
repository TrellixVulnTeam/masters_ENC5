A self-proclaimed activist has gone viral for threatening to "f*** up" police funerals even as NYPD Detective Jason Rivera was being laid to rest.

Rivera and his partner were killed in an ambush-style attack last week as they responded to a call for a domestic dispute.

Tens of thousands of NYPD officers showed up for Rivera's final send-off, crowding the streets of New York City in order to pay their final respects to their brother in blue.

What are the details? 



Harper's Instagram appears to be set to private at the time of this reporting.
