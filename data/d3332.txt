Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick) has threatened Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) following her discovery Pierce Harris is dying in Emmerdale.

Yesterday, Rhona was given a letter written by Pierce, revealing he only has months left and needs help finding his son, Marcus.

Vanessa was shocked learning Rhona’s news, wondering whether she’d actually help the person that made her life a living hell.

Tonight, after some deliberation, Rhona made the decision that she would try and contact Marcus.

While Rhona has been telling Vanessa about the situation, she’s yet to reveal her news to Marlon (Mark Charnock).

Given the fact Pierce was responsible for putting Marlon in prison, Rhona is convinced she’s protecting her partner by keeping everything a secret.

Well, if you ask us, that’ll just make things ten times worse.

With Ryan (James Moore) helping Rhona find Marcus, Vanessa was furious at her friend, still convinced Marcus doesn’t need to know his evil father is dying.

Rhona was adamant she wasn’t making a mistake and asked Vanessa to keep quiet, especially around Marlon.

However, Vanessa told Rhona that if she makes contact with Marcus, she will tell Marlon everything.

Will Vanessa go through with her threat?

How will Marlon feel knowing Rhona has kept this from him?
