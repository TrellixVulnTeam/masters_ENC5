You are putting everything in the same paragraph. The UK helped Ayatollah because they were afraid of a communist takeover. To create a radical Islamic axis. Before Ayatollah, Zia ul Haq came to power in Pakistan.

What Iraqi government? They are many groups. Common Iraqis want both the Americans and the Iranians to leave.

Iran supported the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, the Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood and their crimes in Darfur, the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, the Algerian FIS and also some oter radical groups. They gave help to radical militants in Somalia, in Yemen, in Iraq, in Afghanistan and many of them were more radical than the Muslim Brotherhood. The Taliban wouldn’t be able to control Afghanistan without the help of Iran and Pakistan. Even more radical jihadists admit it.

And the conflicts are not all about US. Many other players are there. Don’t think that the Assad regime with the Russians will tolerate Iran for more actions while Iran is allied with Turkey and Qatar.

Countries like Iraq and Jordan are the moderate ones now. They are trying to take equal distance.
