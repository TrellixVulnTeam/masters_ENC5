Boris Johnson is currently being grilled by the Labour leader at Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), following fresh reports he attended another lockdown-busting event in January 2021 – now being investigated by the Metropolitan Police.

Sir Keir Starmer may also give the PM the opportunity to withdraw remarks he made in the Commons on Monday, that Sir Keir failed to take action against notorious paedophile Jimmy Savile when he was the director of public prosecutions.

It comes as another Conservative MP publicly called time on Mr Johnson’s premiership, announcing he will submit a letter of no confidence later today while insisting the PM should trigger his own vote rather than wait for the 54-letter threshold.

“The question now is, ‘is the prime minister the best person to lead the party moving forward?’” Tobias Ellwood, chair of the Commons defence committee, told Sky News earlier. “I don’t think he realises how worried people are in every corner of the party.” Mr Ellwood joins around 10 other Tories who have publicly confirmed they have submitted letters to the party’s 1922 committee.
