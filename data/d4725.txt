Crime writer Val McDermid has ended her “lifelong support” of Raith Rovers and her sponsorship of them “over their signing of the rapist David Goodwillie”.

The captain of their women’s team also quit in protest, as did one of their directors and their supporter liaison officer, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon speaking out, too, over a move McDermid branded “disgusting and despicable”.

Announcing she was tearing up her season ticket, McDermid posted on Twitter: “The thought of the rapist David Goodwillie running out on the pitch at Starks Park in a Raith Rovers shirt with my name on it makes me feel physically sick.”

Former Scotland striker Goodwillie was found on the balance of probabilities to have raped a woman in 2017 after a landmark civil court case launched when criminal action against him was discontinued due to insufficient evidence.

Raith signed the 32-year-old from Clyde on Monday in defiance of the public objections of McDermid, a former director of the club whose website valmcdermid.com is their main shirt sponsor.

Raith Rovers said in a statement that while it recognised Goodwillie has "divided opinion" among fans, he is considered part of the football club.

"While acknowledging the gravity of what happened ten years ago, as a club we fully support and encourage rehabilitation, and many factors influenced our signing. First and foremost, this was a football related decision," the club said.

Responding to the move on Tuesday, McDermid wrote:
