Here’s the little craft beer jargon dictionary of some of the most common terms:
• ABV - stands for ‘alcohol by volume’ which is a measurement of the alcohol content or strength as a percentage.
• Ales - beers fermented with top-fermenting yeast, they are typically fermented at warmer temperatures than lagers, and are often served warmer.
• Bitterness - in beer is caused by the tannins and hops. The amount of bitterness in a beer is one of the defining characteristics of a beer style.
• Body - the consistency, thickness and mouth-filling property of a beer.
• DDH - double dry-hopped, simply means using twice as many hops as you would normally use for the same beer.
• Dry Hopping - when hops are added late in the brewing process to increase the hop aroma of a finished beer without significantly affecting its bitterness.
• Hops - it’s a green cone-shaped flower of the Humulus lupulus plant. They give the beer a particular flavour and aroma.
• IPA - stands for India pale ale. This is a beer that was created in England and was then exported overseas. Its name is a result of its popularity with British troops stationed in India in the 19th century.
• Milkshake IPA - the use of lactose and fruit gives a smooth, delightful mouthfeel.
• NEIPA - a very popular style, a New England IPA has a tropical fruit hop aroma and flavour, dry-hopped to the point of being hazy, smoother and less bitter than typical IPAs.
• Porter - a style of beer that was developed in London in the early 18th century, dark in appearance owing to the use of brown malt and popular with street and river porters.
• Sour - beer with an intentionally acidic or sour taste, and are often compared to NEIPAs with added tartness.
