Four months after reports that the head of one its most prestigious programs had abruptly resigned, Yale University is forming a committee to review its gift policies to ensure that academic freedom would be safeguarded from undue donor influence.

The committee, whose creation was first reported by The Yale Daily News, will consist of faculty members and administrative staff selected by Yale’s president, Peter Salovey. A university spokeswoman, Karen Peart, said that Salovey “will provide more details when he announces the committee, which will be soon.”

Concerns about inappropriate donor influence at Yale rose after The New York Times reported in September that Beverly Gage, a professor of history, had quietly resigned as head of the Grand Strategy program after the administration in her view had failed to defend against interference in the curriculum by two of the university’s most prominent and deep-pocketed donors. One of those donors had given Yale $500 million — the largest gift in its history.

Gage, a scholar of 20th-century American political history who had led the program since 2017, said that in November 2020, after a colleague in the program published an opinion article in The Times criticizing President Donald Trump as a demagogue who threatened the Constitution, she received the first of what became a string of inquiries and concerns about the program from the donors.
