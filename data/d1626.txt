Eagle-eyed Emmerdale fans were left distracted as Kim Tate questioned her future.

Her partner Will Taylor noticed she seemed a bit off as his daughter Dawn Taylor excitedly plans her wedding to Billy Fletcher.

After a bit of nudging, and thinking she was jealous of Dawn setting a date for her big day while they haven't begun planning theirs, Kim confessed to Will that she is feeling a bit lost.

Kim has been admitted to struggling since her granddaughter Millie left the village after her mum, Andrea's, death and following the suspected death of her son Jamie Tate.

Will was heard encouraging Kim that she needs a new project.

And there's one role viewers think she's being lined up for.

"Kim wants a new challenge. The Woolpack. #Emmerdale," @JamieNews81 said.

@mikepriestley13 added: "Wondering if Kim will try and buy the woolpack? #Emmerdale."

But despite the intriguing conversation, Emmerdale viewers were distracted by a very obvious blunder.

@BIsbeki said: "Loving that glossy plastic fruit on Kim tates table #emmerdale."

"#Emmerdale That fruit looked very fake. Especially those bananas," @Arnold__Simon tweeted.
