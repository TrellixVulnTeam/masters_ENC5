NIOSH approved N95 masks are not approved to filter pathogens. They also carry warning labels. Using a N95 mask for anything other than the approved NIOSH certification is against regulations.

If a business forces you to wear a N95 mask, the fine can be up to $35k for each violation of the regulations. They must also have a trained compliance officer on site to do proper fitment tests. The business also must have a training manual and be up to date with certifications.

Companies used to take workplace safety very seriously, until Covid. So I guess every company that was fined by OSHA in the past can get their fines reversed and refunded. If OSHA isnâ€™t going to follow their own guidelines now, then everything is null and void.
