The Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) continues to hunt down ISIS cells with support from local intelligence and security agencies.

On January 30, F-16 fighter jets of the IQAF targeted a hideout of ISIS located on a hill near the town of Sheikh Younis in the northern province of Nineveh. The airstrikes eliminated a cell of six terrorists.

On February 2, IQAF fighter jets targeted a cave in Hatra desert, also located in Nineveh, where a cell of ISIS was taking shelter. All terrorists were killed.

Recently, the IQAF began playing a larger role in the war on ISIS in cooperation with the other branches of the military, the intelligence and security forces.

A series of Iraqi airstrikes that targeted the eastern province of Diyala on January 29 eliminated an ISIS cell responsible for the January 21 Hawi al-â€˜Azim attack, which claimed the lives of 11 Iraqi service members. Nine terrorists, including Lebanese nationals, were killed in the airstrikes.

The IQAF support provides the rest of Iraqi government forces with the ability to strike any ISIS target in the country with high-precision on a short notice.
