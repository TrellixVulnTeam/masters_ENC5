A COLLEGE teacher has rowed to victory in a regional championships after just one year in the sport.

Barton Peveril Sixth Form College Sociology teacher, Haley Jordan has won the Hampshire and Dorset Novice Rowing Championships.

Taking place at Royal Victoria Country Park on September 18, the competition saw the college lecturer take the top spot whilst representing her club, Coalporters Amateur Rowing Club.

Taking part after only one year in the sport, Haley Jordan previously enjoyed rowing indoors for fun, occasionally entering competitions such as the English Indoor Rowing Championships at Manchester Velodrome, the Scottish Indoor Championships, British Virtual Championships, World Rowing Virtual Masters, and the Australian Indoor Rowing Championships.

During the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Barton Peveril Teacher rowed a half-marathon to raise money for a domestic violence charity.

But when lockdown eased, Haley took her passion for rowing indoors out onto the water.

The club also features current Barton Peveril students Ella Newman and Alice Warland Drumgoole.

The Teacher had a successful first season competing on the water, progressing from the Novice to the Junior crew quickly whilst also representing the Masters crew.

During her fast rise to championship-winning rower, Haley Jordan won the ‘Most Improved Oarsman’ prize at the club’s annual awards ceremony.

She said: "Learning a new skill such as rowing has been really challenging but immensely satisfying. Coalporters is such a friendly and welcoming club and have supported me all the way. Being part of a squad that won the Hampshire and Dorset Novice championship has made me very proud."
