That’s where things stood — publicly, at least — until last week, when new details emerged about the May 2014 case, which happened 50 miles away in Jersey City.

That case involved the death of Michael Galdieri, the son of a former state senator. Last week, Sean Caddle, 44, a political consultant who had employed Galdieri and had close ties to some North Jersey Democrats, pleaded guilty to hiring two men who stabbed Galdieri and set fire to his apartment. It was not clear why he wanted Galdieri killed.

Mark Sheridan, the son of the victims in the September case, immediately saw a possible connection. He told New Jersey’s acting attorney general and the Somerset County prosecutor in a letter that “your offices all but laughed at my family’s suggestion that my parents’ deaths were anything other than a murder-suicide.” He said that both offices had “openly mocked the idea of a killing for hire involving a stabbing with a fire set to destroy evidence.”

He also called their attention to a knife found when the police stopped and searched a pickup truck in connection with a 2014 bank robbery in Connecticut.

He said the investigators in New Jersey had repeatedly asked about a knife that was missing from the kitchen of his parents’ house. He suggested that the authorities obtain DNA evidence from the knife in the pickup truck to see whether it was linked to their deaths.
