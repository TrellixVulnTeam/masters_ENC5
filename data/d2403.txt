Before I get into my experience trying slugging, let’s look at how this trend came to be. The viral “slugging trend,” as it’s been seen on TikTok for the past couple of years, is believed to have originated in South Korea as part of K-beauty skincare trends (like double-cleansing and glass skin). However, you don’t have to use Vaseline to slug – any petroleum-based product can do. So if you’re not a fan of Vaseline, you could use Aquaphor, CeraVe, or Cetaphil to slug your skin. The main idea is to seal moisture into your skin by preventing transepidermal water loss (or, in plainer terms, stop the moisture from evaporating off your skin).

That being said, Vaseline is the go-to petroleum-based product for most TikTok videos on slugging. And while Vaseline is seeing a resurgence as it’s “rediscovered” by the internet, it’s important to acknowledge that using Vaseline for skin care is not new – in fact, Vaseline is a staple skincare product in the Black community that has been used for generations. In 2020, Vaseline even partnered with Shalom Blac, Sloane Stephens, and Cristina Martinez to further deepen its connection with the Black community and create the Illuminate Me collection.



As for why Vaseline and slugging are trending on TikTok now, it could be because it’s a great way to keep your skin moisturized in the winter – a time when a lot of people deal with drier skin. When asked about slugging, Dr. Peter Lio, an assistant professor of Clinical Dermatology & Pediatrics at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, , "Heavy occlusive agents and protectants like these can actually be a great idea, especially in the winter. They help lock moisture in, but also add a physical layer of protection from the wind and cold."



Commonly used products in "slugging" are Aquaphor, Vaseline, or Cerave's Healing Ointment. The best part of this hack? Every item listed is less than $10.
