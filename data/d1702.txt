That’s what he said. Dr. Evil said it will not happen. It wasn’t unclear, he wasn’t hedging his bets, he didn’t imply or intimate or suggest. He said outright that it’s never going to happen.

The only unspoken part was left unspoken not because he doesn’t dare say it but because he thinks we all better dang well know it if we know what’s best for us. The unspoken part was that HE WON’T ALLOW IT to go back.

That’s what he said in this audio clip.

“Normal will not be exactly the way it was before all of this.”

Normal to him means routine boosters. Normal to him means mandates on demand, lockdowns whenever it suits him. We won’t go back to the “Before” normal because he didn’t have any power in that normal. He means the NEW normal, just like his far left allies say all the time.
