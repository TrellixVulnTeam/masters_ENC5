A BLOKE has revealed how he was able to make almost £500 profit after buying a returns pallet full of hundreds of pounds worth of toys.

Ryan does reselling for a living, buying returned products and flogging them at carboots or on eBay “to avoid the normal 9-5 life.”

He shared his recent haul on his YouTube channel, Wonky Clamp, having purchased a nursery returns pallet and a toys returns pallet for a total of £354.21.

While Ryan admitted that he was more interested in the toys, the nursery one proved to be almost as fruitful.

It contained three Cuggl prams retailing at a whopping £160 each, more than making up for what he had paid for the two pallets in total.

But it was the toy pallet that had the real value, containing dozens of items including Peppa Pig, and Disney Merchandise as well as scooters and gaming equipment.

Ryan hit the jackpot with two boxes of Lego goodies, including a Land Rover model with a retail price of £120 and a Harry Potter Hogwarts set worth £80.

“The Land Rover lego pays for half of the toy pallet on its own, I’m so happy,” he remarks.

While some of the items in Ryan’s pallet are listed as damaged, after testing them he finds that most of them have no issues whatsoever.

He says: “I’ve worked out what I think I can get for everything and that’s kind of lowballing some of it/

“£483 obviously you’ve got to take eBay fees out of that but not everything is being sold on eBay and shipping

“So I think I will be able to double my money.”
