REGAN Gascoigne stunned Dancing on Ice viewers last night with an incredible performance to Singin' In The Rain.

The dancer achieved the second highest score on the DOI leader board so far, receiving 33.5 for his performance to Singin' In The Rain.

The 25-year-old brought his former footballer father Paul Gascoigne "almost to tears" in the audience after channelling Gene Kelly skating with professional skater Karina Manta.

Head judge Christopher Dean added that movie star Kelly would be "smiling" after his performance but asked for more difficult chorography next time.
