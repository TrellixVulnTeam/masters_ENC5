I love Darger’s book that collects the weather reports in Chicago.

I started but haven’t finished a book called “Storm” (1941) by George R. Stewart. It’s an old book, and it’s told from the point of view of a storm. The book review said, “The only other book like this is Darger’s.”

Do you see yourself in Darger and Finster?

A little bit. But I’m quite a bit more functional in certain ways — I function within, say, an art gallery.

Is there art you’ve made that moves you?

There are things that have been pivotal for me. When Talking Heads went from a four-piece to a nine- or ten-piece, that was a change in how it felt. There was a documentary that I did years later called “Îlé Aiyé (The House of Life)” (1989), about Candomblé Brazilian spirituality; I spent time in Bahia, and that was very moving. The Broadway show I’m doing now, I do a lot of talking. That has been transformative.

How do you procrastinate?

I try not to procrastinate very much. If emails are coming in, I try to answer them as quickly as possible, otherwise they’ll sink to the bottom, below anywhere you’re ever going to find them. I wonder if we’re actually getting more done with email and digital communication or getting less done. I can’t tell. You send a response, and a response to the response, and then you’ve got to respond to that. And then it comes back. If you were sitting like we are, you’d go back and forth for a few minutes. And you’d be done.
