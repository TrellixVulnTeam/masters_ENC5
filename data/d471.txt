BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese ships and aircraft trailed two U.S. warships as they passed through the Taiwan Strait on Thursday, China's Defence Ministry said, denouncing the mission as "provocation".

"The Chinese People's Liberation Army maintains a high level of alert at all times, responds to all threats and provocations at all times, and resolutely defends national sovereignty and territorial integrity," the ministry said in a statement.
