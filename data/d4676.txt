A HUNKY burglar whose police mugshot was swooned over by an army of women online has been caught by cops.

Wanted pictures of 6ft Jonathan Cahill, 37, were circulated when he allegedly broke the terms of his jail release.

Online admirers posted comments such as “If I find him, can I keep him?” and “He can hide under my bed.”

But West Yorkshire Police have beaten them to it. Officers said: “He has now been arrested and is in custody.”

Not all of his fans are giving up though.

Lena Cunliffe posted: “The offer to keep him under house arrest if the prison’s full still stands.”

Kaz Lesley joked: “The largest search party ever can now be disbanded!”

And Rachel Cheetham added: “I bet he handed himself in out of fear!”
