The Wall Street Journal, owned by the same corporate conglomerate as Fox News, is claiming that President Donald Trump’s push for $2,000-per-person stimulus checks is hurting the Republican Party’s chances at keeping two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia.

“Senate Republicans oppose the $2,000 for these sound reasons, but Mr. Trump has put them in a political spot. Democrats immediately joined Mr. Trump’s call for the $2,000, and on Monday they passed the larger amount through the House, 275-134,” the WSJ editorial board wrote.

By working for the American people, President Trump is putting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) in a bind, the WSJ argues. They apparently believe that Trump should put party over country as other Republican leaders have done in the past.

“That leaves Mr. McConnell with a tough call of barring a vote as Democrats bang away in TV ads in Georgia against GOP incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler,” the editorial wrote. “Or he can hold a vote, which would split the GOP caucus and upset fiscally conservative voters.”

The WSJ wants President Trump to accept the vote steal, coronate “president-elect” Joe Biden, take orders from McConnell, and then meekly allow the establishment forces that shamefully turned their heads on election fraud to take back control over the party.

“By all accounts Mr. Trump is angry about his election defeat, and he is lashing out at anyone who won’t indulge his hopeless campaign to overturn it. … Mr. Trump’s narcissism isn’t news. But if Republicans lose the two Georgia seats and their majority, Republicans across the country should know to thank Mr. Trump for their 2021 tax increase,” they wrote.

Big League Politics has reported on the collapse of the Georgia GOP since the election, with Republican officials obstructing an investigation into countless electoral abnormalities, and Gov. Brian Kemp rolling out the red carpet for China to dominate his state’s economy:

As Georgia Governor Brian Kemp betrays his nation and his constituents, conservative patriots have been baffled as to why a prominent Republican could act in such a disreputable and cowardly manner. A recent promotional video recorded by Kemp might explain why he is so intent upon selling his country down the river. Kemp has an entire website, georgiabusiness.cn, devoted to globalism with regards to China. He is essentially begging foreigners to come into his state and set up shop, under the guise that rolling over to an enemy is good for business… Kemp can be seen talking up the Chinese threat in an embarrassing and borderline treasonous promotional video as well. “China is a top source of imports. We welcome thousands of Chinese visitors every year to the Peach State, and we are constantly helping to develop new opportunities for Chinese companies,” Kemp said in order to brownnose his Chinese masters. The video also features many Chinese individuals smiling ear to ear about how they’re making such a killing in Georgia at the expense of the native work force… It has never been easier to see who the traitors are among the Republican ranks. Kemp acted like an “America First” Trump Republican for years when it benefitted his political ambitions and now he’s taken the role as overseer of sorts for the coordinated steal operation in Georgia.

The Republican establishment is sowing the seeds to blame President Trump if the GOP blows it in Georgia. They may be even more corrupt than the Democrat establishment, if that can be believed, and the Wall Street Journal is one of the deceptive media organs promoting their anti-Trump propaganda.
