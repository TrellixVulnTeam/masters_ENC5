ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 2 (UPI) -- SpaceX is planning two Falcon 9 rocket launches within hours Wednesday on both coasts of the United States, one for Starlink and one for the U.S. government.

First, the space company plans to send a classified payload into orbit from California for the National Reconnaissance Office, which is a U.S. intelligence agency that builds and operates spy satellites.
