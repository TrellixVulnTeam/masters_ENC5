Mr. Throckmorton would not take questions from a reporter who knocked on his door on Wednesday morning. He said he had just recovered from Covid-19 and had spent months in a hospital this year from a stroke. His doctor had told him he could not afford for his blood pressure to get any higher, he said.

“I’ve already made all the statements I can make,” he said.

A lawyer for Mr. Throckmorton, Jim Roberts, said that he denied standing in the way of investigators. “He wanted them to search the home,” Mr. Roberts said. “Throckmorton followed up with police to make sure they had gone over there.”

Mr. Roberts said Mr. Throckmorton did not represent Mr. Warner at the time of the police investigation and had only provided legal services for a previous real estate transaction.

The incident report, dated Aug. 21, noted that the officers who responded to the call had notified their superiors within the Police Department. The police said they had forwarded the incident report and Mr. Warner’s information to the F.B.I., which said on Tuesday that it and the Defense Department found no records on Mr. Warner after receiving a request from the police on Aug. 22.

Chief Drake told reporters on Wednesday that he did not learn of the report until Sunday night. “I wanted to know what happened,” he said. “I wanted to know: What did the officers do, what was the follow-up investigation, what all do we know?”

He said that officers did not try to contact Mr. Warner after the first week of attempts, and that he was unsure if the initial case was considered open.
