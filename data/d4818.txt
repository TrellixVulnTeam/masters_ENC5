Feb. 1 (UPI) -- A Florida man who took his grandson magnet fishing in a canal said the duo reeled in a pair of unexpected items: sniper rifles.

Duane Smith said he watched a YouTube video about magnet fishing, the practice of casting a line with a magnet into the water to see what items can be brought up to the surface, and decided to give it a try in a Miami-Dade County canal with his grandson, Allen Cadwalader, 11.
