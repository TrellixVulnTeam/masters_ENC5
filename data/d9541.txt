Mr. Zucker’s relationship with Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer for CNN, was revealed during an investigation into Chris Cuomo’s sexual misconduct.

Although both Zucker and Allison Gollust are divorced, Zucker did not disclose their relationship, as required.

“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong. As a result, I am resigning today,” Zucker wrote in a memo.

“I have accepted Jeff Zucker’s resignation as Chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports, and President of CNN Worldwide. We thank Jeff for his contributions over the past 9 years,” Jason Kilar, CEO of WarnerMedia said in an email to staffers.

Kilar added, “We will be announcing an interim leadership plan shortly. Both of these organizations are at the top of their respective games and are well prepared for their next chapters.”

A quick recap of what the newsroom at CNN has looked like in the last year:
• Producer Rick Saleeby forced out for soliciting underage photos and is under criminal investigation
• Jeffrey “Zoomin” Toobin exposed himself during a virtual meeting with colleagues

Mr. Zucker has been widely criticized for not doing enough about the sex scandals, perverts and pedophiles at CNN.

And now we know why! He was involved in his own sex scandal.
