And South Korea made them pay in the very next minute, as Kwon Chang-hoon, who was brought in off the bench to begin the second half, doubled the lead with a great individual effort. After securing the ball on the right side, Kwon cut to the middle and fired a left-footed shot into the short side. The midfielder has now scored three goals in his past four matches, all within a 16-day span.
