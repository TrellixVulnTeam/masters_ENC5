Middlesbrough is one of the most deprived parts of the UK. The area asked to be levelled up and at the heart of that is the development of the former steelworks on Teesside, with the promise of about 20,000 jobs. It's still a derelict site and, like with today's announcement, people can't yet see or feel the change. The question now is do they have the patience to wait?
