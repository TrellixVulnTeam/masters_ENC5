The competition's winner for a single image was Tanmay Sapkal from the US, who photographed a mystical scene on top of Mount Tamalpais, north of San Francisco.

Commenting on his entry, he said: "It is quite a special place for photographers as it stands above the local landscape which is engulfed in low coastal fog almost every summer evening.

"After shooting there tens of times over the last four years, I realised that I really liked the way fog looks when it is lit from underneath. I also realised that the comet would become visible in the north-west sky, so I started planning this shot.

"It wasnâ€™t possible to line up the comet exactly above the foreground I wanted, so I decided to take two separate exposures. It took a couple of visits to get just the right amount of fog on the hills to create the dreamy setting and then I waited patiently for some cars to drive by and create a blanket of light under the fog.

"After shooting for more than a few hours that night, my friend and I hurried back down to the car. Little did we know that parking on the mountain after sunset meant getting a parking ticket! But now, in my opinion, it's the best $80 I have ever spent on parking."
