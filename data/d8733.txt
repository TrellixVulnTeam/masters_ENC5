BTS star Jimin has provided a health update to his worried fans after he contracted appendicitis and Covid-19.

The K-Pop star, 26, shared a message to fans via Weverse, following the news of his diagnoses.

On Monday, the superstar underwent surgery and his agency issued a statement to say that he’d had successful appendicitis surgery.

On Wednesday, he issued a statement to his own social media channels.

He said: ‘Everyone, you must have worried a lot right? I am recovering well!’

Jimin added: ‘I’m sorry to have worried you. But, I think I can be discharged soon! I am recovering well too and I am eating all three meals a day. Please wait for just a little, I will return quickly after recovery.’

Jimin’s agency had previously said: ‘According to the medical staff, the surgery was successful, and Jimin is currently recuperating after his procedure.

‘He will be receiving a few days of inpatient treatment for Covid-19 in conjunction with post-operative care.

‘He is currently experiencing a mild sore throat but is making a speedy recovery, and had no contact with the other members during the infectious stage.

‘The company places the artists’ health as our top priority, and we will do everything we can to aid Jimin in his speedy recovery. We will also diligently cooperate with the requests and guidelines of the healthcare authorities.’

Three other members of the band, RM, Jin and Suga, tested positive for Covid in December and have all since made full recoveries.

Since their launch in 2013, the band BTS have won global recognition for their music as well as their activism, which has included giving a speech at the UN, as well as addressing anti-Asian racism.

The band have released numerous albums as well as EPs, including achieving two UK number one hits. Last year, they collaborated with British rock band Coldplay, on the track My Universe.
