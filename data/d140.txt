Alexander Wang is facing allegations of sexual misconduct after multiple accusers came forward on social media accusing the fashion designer of drugging and assaulting them, according to a new report.

The 37-year-old New York City designer was accused of being a 'sexual predator' by several anonymous accusers, many of whom claimed Wang had drugged their drinks with MDMA and sexually assaulted them at events in recent years, WWD reported.

Wang, who became known for his star-studded parties following the success of his fashion label launch in 2005, declined to comment on WWD's report on Tuesday.

Representatives for Wang did not respond to DailyMail.com's repeated requests for comment.

Allegations against Wang went viral on Monday after they were shared on Instagram by industry watchdog, Sh*t Model Management, who urged the public to boycott his label, according to the report.

'Alexander Wang is an alleged sexual predator, many male models and trans models have come out and spoken about the alleged sexual abuse that Alexander Wang has inflicted upon them,' the post read.

'It is important to show your support to these victims by unfollowing Alexander Wang and boycotting his clothing line.'

Included in the post was a video clip by model Owen Mooney, who had earlier uploaded a TikTok video claiming he had been 'touched up' by a 'really famous' fashion designer in 2017.

Although Mooney did not initially name his alleged abuser, he later uploaded a follow-up TikTok following speculation from viewers and confirmed he had been talking about Wang.

In the video, which has since gone viral, Mooney claimed he had been at a crowded New York City club where he and a few friends had gone to watch rapper CupcakKe perform.

'I was by myself at one point and this guy next to me obviously took at advantage of the fact that no one could f**king move,' Mooney says in the video.

'And he just started touching me up. Like, fully up my leg, in my crotch. It made me freeze completely me because I was in so much shock.

'And then I look to my left to see who it was and it was a really famous fashion designer and I just couldn't believe that he was doing that to me,' Mooney added.

The model went on to describe the incident as 'really f**ked up', saying he then had to 'slowly move away' from the designer.

Mooney's account was one of at least seven included in the post on Monday, the majority of which were shared through screenshots of allegations sent in by anonymous users, according to the report.

The allegations against Wang were also reported by The Daily Beast.

One accuser claimed their friend, who is a trans man, had been riding in a limo with Wang after a party 'a while ago' when the designer offered him water and made sure he drank it all.

'A few moments after, they noticed they were rolling and had been giving molly water,' the anonymous person claimed.

'This was a regular occurrence because a year after being told this story, I also heard other people confirm that they also got drugged on the way to any after party.'

Another alleged victim also claimed Wang had done the same 'Molly water trick on me', while another accused him of drugging two friends in 2014.

On Tuesday, fashion advocacy organization Model Alliance, released a statement in support of Wang's accusers.

'We at Model Alliance stand in solidarity with those who have shared accusations of sexual abuse by Alexander Wang,' it said in an Instagram post.

'Lets be clear: The fashion industry's lack of transparency and accountability leaves all models vulnerable to abuse, regardless of their sex or gender identity.'
