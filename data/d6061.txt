The MP's costs were up from £181,855.01 the year before, but below the average for all Members of Parliament, of £203,880.

Business costs are the essential costs incurred by MPs while carrying out their parliamentary duties including staffing, office costs and travel.

MPs cannot claim for personal costs, such as food and drink, during their normal working day, and all claims must be compliant with IPSA rules and accompanied by evidence.

At the other end of the scale, the smallest one-off expense the 58-year-old claimed was £1.00 for ctm rail booking fee.

The average cost of an MP was up 29 per cent, from £158,103, in 2019-20.

Kit Malthouse was the most expensive MP attending the Cabinet in 2020-21, with total costs of £244,312.

This was compared to £178,406 for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and £168,109 for Sir Keir Starmer.

Mr Garnier said of the rise in payroll costs that his office reclassified a case worker to "senior caseworker" reflecting her "excellent five years in post".

He replaced his previous parliamentary assistant, with double staffing required over the handover period.

Mr Garnier has said he has also reduced the cost of accommodation in Wyre Forest by moving office to a more efficient space in Stourport.
