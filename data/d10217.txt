The permanent rule replaces a temporary one that was set to expire on Jan. 28, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.

Oregon health and education officials have required masks in schools as one mitigation strategy meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, so students can stay in school full time.

Oregon education officials say any repeal of the making rules depend on the course of the coronavirus.

Health officials said that COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, transmission data, vaccination rates, and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all play a role in the mask requirement decision-making.

The CDC continues to recommend “universal indoor masking” for everyone in schools, regardless of vaccination status.

In Oregon, OHA officials heard from some people late last month speaking out against the masking requirements in schools, with many asking that the decision be placed in the hands of local school districts.

“COVID-19 does not recognize borders and Oregonians do travel between counties,” wrote OHA officials in response to the calls for local control. “Community spread of COVID-19 remains high in Oregon.”

One school district has decided to ignore the state’s masking requirement — the Alsea School District in Benton County. As a result, some of the district’s federal funding is in jeopardy.
