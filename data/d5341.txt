Suspected militiamen have attacked a camp for internally displaced people in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), killing dozens of people, according to local sources and a monitoring group.

The overnight assault took place in the DRC’s restive Ituri province, which has been placed under a state of siege since May 2021, an exceptional measure taken by the government to combat armed groups roaming the country’s mineral-rich east.

“At least 40 civilians were killed with edged weapons last night in Plaine Savo” in Djugu territory, the Kivu Security Tracker (KST), which monitors violence in the region, said on Twitter on Wednesday.

Reuters news agency, citing the head of a local humanitarian group and a witness, said the death toll was at least 60.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but KST said fighters from the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo armed group, known as CODECO, were suspected of being behind the raid.
