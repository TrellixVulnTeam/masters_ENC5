PETOSKEY, Mich. — Becky Beer has been a waitress for 10 years at J.W. Filmore’s Family Restaurant.

She received the tip of a lifetime on Tuesday: An anonymous customer left a $2,021 gratuity on a $44.69 takeout order at the Michigan restaurant.

“It was crazy with Facebook and people reaching out to me,” Beer said. “Some people I haven’t talked to in a long time congratulating me. It was just crazy yesterday (Tuesday) the amount of people messaging me and congratulating me.”

A note atop the receipt read “JBN Tip Challenge, Just Be Nice, 2021 Happy New Year.”

“It’s just amazing, there’s so many people in this area, in particular this region that it could have happened to,” Beer said. “I feel almost guilty... I was asking myself, ‘Why me, why did this happen?,’ because there’s so many people that need it."

She plans to pay it forward after using a portion of the tip to pay bills and place money into a family foundation established after her uncle's death.

Beer said while the recent closure of dine-in service for restaurants has been difficult, this summer J.W. Filmore’s had record sales.

“It was the busiest summer we’ve ever had,” Beer said. “It was very busy, yet different with all the changes and I kind of knew later this year another shutdown was coming. With the holiday season here and with all of employees, it’s terrible. Some of them got another job to offset things.”

J.W. Filmore’s owner Erika Closs said with all bars and restaurants being shut down because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it’s been tough.

“It’s unbelievable that someone would be that thoughtful and generous to do that,” Closs said. “Especially with the holidays and this time of year and with what everyone has been going through.”

Beer said she plans to do just what the note atop the receipt said.

“I will just be nice,” Beer said.
