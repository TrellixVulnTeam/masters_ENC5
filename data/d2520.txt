Like Kramer, many people during this surge have gotten negative results on at-home tests only to later learn that they actually had COVID-19 — a fact that comes as the federal government pushes to get more free at-home tests into people’s hands. Experts, however, say the at-home tests remain as accurate as they’ve ever been, even with the omicron variant. Rather, experts attribute the false negatives to other possible factors: no test is 100% accurate, people may not be administering them correctly, or people are testing too early to detect their COVID-19 infections.
