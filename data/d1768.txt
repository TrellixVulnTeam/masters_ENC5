GERMAN TV investigators probing Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B claim to have handed over crucial evidence to prosecutors that could help snare him.

The convicted rapist, 45, has emerged as the prime suspect in Maddie's disappearance 15 years ago.

A new documentary aired on German TV claiming Christian B worked as a repairman at the same holiday apartments where young Maddie was snatched.

The German paedo is said to have been called out "repeatedly" to the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz and was "very familiar" with the layout and lived in a campervan nearby.

Now, producers of the bombshell documentary say they've handed over their findings to authorities in Germany.

Speaking to The Sun, a spokesperson for German prosecutor Hans-Christian Wolters confirmed that the SAT.1 documentary team had handed over its material when it came to conduct an interview at the public prosecution office.

Christian B was sensationally named as the prime suspect for Maddie's disappearance almost two years ago, with prosecutors even suspecting he had murdered her.

Three-year-old Maddie vanished from her parent's Kate and Gerry's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on Portugal's Algarve coast in May 2007 and has never been found.

But since then there has been little progress, with no sign of him being charged with any involvement in the disappearance of Maddie.

Now in a series of letters to a German TV station and broadcast on Monday night, Christian B dismissed the case against him.

He wrote: "Even if at the moment attempts are being made to create a shattering overall picture of me with bought-in witnesses, it is the essential questions, the decisive questions, that will never be answered with a 'yes'.

"Was I or my vehicle clearly seen near the crime scene on the night of the crime? Are there DNA traces of me at the crime scene?

“Are there DNA traces of the injured party in my vehicle? Are there any other traces of the damaged party in my possession? Photos? And, not to forget, is there a dead body?

"This public propaganda against me has been going on for (almost a year and a half now). However, I myself have not been heard on a single accusation so far."

In another letter Christian B said it would have been "absurd" for him to have abducted the little girl because it would have put his drug dealing business at risk.

He said: "I was never caught by the police because I followed a few key principles.

“Where possible, only driving during the day so that my battered 'hippy bus' didn't attract attention, only driving on the roads I needed to and, most importantly, never provoking the police.

“So that means not committing any crimes, certainly not abducting anyone.

"Having said that, this was just as absurd to me at the time as starting a nuclear war or slaughtering a chicken."

He added: "I see no reason to comment on the accusations made by the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office. In theory, I could sit back and relax and just wait for the findings."

The letters were part of a programme broadcast last night on German TV station Sat 1.

An earlier episode revealed Christian B had intimate knowledge Maddie's holiday home in the Algarve.

A “reliable” witness said he “repeatedly carried out repair work” at the apartments where Kate and Gerry McCann stayed with their children, reports the Daily Telegraph.

Sat.1 said: “A reconstruction of the evening of the crime and extensive research in Portugal and Germany found that Christian B was very familiar with the Ocean Club area in Praia da Luz.

“Prior to Maddie’s disappearance, he repeatedly carried out repair work at the place where the three-year-old disappeared in 2007.”

The holiday complex has not commented on the claims.

He is also being probed over a series of rapes and sex attacks on the Algarve.

His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher has previously told The Sun: "For almost two years this has carried on - for the sake of the McCann's and my client the prosecutor office should say what the evidence is."

Fulscher has declined to comment about the new material being handed over to German prosecutors.
