LIFESAVERS are being sought to patrol some of Hampshire's most popular beaches this summer.

The RNLI has launched a search for budding new lifeguards to rescue those in difficulty and help promote safe behaviour so visitors can return home safely after a day at the beach.

RNLI lead lifeguard supervisor Kester Sheppard said: "Beach lifeguarding can be a great opportunity and a very rewarding role. You could change lives – including your own – all whilst enjoying the beach as your office.

"You can gain some invaluable skills and training whilst working on the beach and being part of an incredible team.

"As long as you can meet the fitness requirements, pass the interview and you are over school leaving age, there can be a role for you as a lifesaver.

"We have lifeguards who have been working for the RNLI for years, both on the beach and as part of our support teams. It really is a great opportunity."

In 2020 alone, the charity’s lifeguards responded to more than 10,687 incidents and helped just over 25,000 people, saving 110 lives.
