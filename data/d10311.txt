Justin Trudeau is in way over his head.

He’s a coward for one, as made evident by his decision to run and hide from the Truckers Freedom Convoy.

He also apparently has the mental capacity of a 13-year-old girl, given his recent desperate attempt to paint the convoy as antisemitic, Islamophobic, homophobic, anti-black, and transphobic.

Trudeau posted on Twitter, suggesting that the freedom loving truckers were somehow guilty of every single “ism” in the book.

These are the words of someone who is desperate and scared.

Do these look like violent racists to you?

Trudeau has continually spread lies and misinformation about these freedom loving truckers:

Trudeau can continue to hide and spew hateful rhetoric, but the truckers aren’t going anywhere anytime soon:

Candice Bergen, a member of Canadian Parliament, is now calling on Trudeau to apologize to the truckers.

She labeled Trudeau a hypocrite for accusing them of spewing “hateful rhetoric,” when he’s the one who has worn blackface multiple times.

More on her comments from Daily Mail:

A conservative Canadian parliamentarian slammed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday as she condemned him for refusing to speak with thousands of truckers demonstrating against the country’s vaccine mandate. Speaking before the House of Commons, Canadian MP Candice Bergen reminded her fellow parliamentarians that the prime minister has donned blackface ‘more times than he can remember,’ after he claimed that the demonstrators in the Freedom Convoy were spreading ‘hateful rhetoric.’ ‘All Canadians want to see a leader who will work to heal riffs, not further divide, a leader who will listen even to those voices he might not agree with, a leader who will work to understand, not dismiss, name-call and gaslight,’ Bergen began.
