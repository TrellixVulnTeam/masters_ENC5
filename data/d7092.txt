THIS is the moment a bungling Yodel driver ploughs over a woman's front lawn.

Hannah Cammock said the van's wheel left a "huge imprint" in the grass.

Hannah, from Cardiff, Wales, took to Twitter to blast the delivery driver.

She shared a clip of the incident, showing the large, white van wheeling over a small patch of grass outside her home.

The van then stops at an angle on her drive, while still partially parked on the garden, and a woman hops out to retrieve a package from the back.

The male driver can be seen in the driver's seat.

Bizarrely, the delivery woman skirts round the green patch, despite half the van and at least one wheel being stationed on it.

Hannah fumed: "Seriously @YodelOnline do you think this is ok?

"That patch of grass is ours that now has a huge imprint.

"We are trying to restore the grass!

"This isn’t the first time this driver has driver over our grass!"

Replying to her tweet, Andy Backhill joked: "I love the way the van drove over the grass but the woman chose to skirt round it. Sorry to laugh."

Hannah responded that it was a "bl***y joke".

And Gerald Davies jibed: "As it’s yodel I’d be glad I actually got my parcel."

When contacted by The Sun a spokesperson for Yodel confirmed the incident was being investigated.
