Shipping companies have expanded their fleets, but the impact has been canceled out by the number of vessels marooned off ports.

“A ship that’s queued up is not a ship that’s moving stuff back and forth across the ocean,” Mr. Levy, the Flexport chief economist, said. “It’s a floating warehouse.”

Many economists assumed that after a few months, Americans would exhaust their demand for products, allowing the supply chain to catch up. As vaccines reached the bloodstream and the pandemic loosened its grip on many parts of the world, it was thought that consumers would stop buying stand mixers and return to restaurants.

This shift has yet to happen meaningfully — a seeming testament to the economic impact of Covid-19 variants like Delta and Omicron, which have led many to return to social isolation.

The biggest uncertainty centers on what happens next.

Once a household spends several thousand dollars to outfit an exercise room in the basement, its occupants may not return to their old gym after the pandemic ends. Rather than shell out for a gym membership, they may opt to invest in additional gear at home, adding more weights or an elliptical.

As white-collar professionals begin a third year in their home offices, attending video conferences in sweatpants, how many will jump at the chance to again don business attire? And what does that mean for retailers that sell such clothing?

These are merely some of the variables at play as businesses try to divine the future. The dearth of solid information may dissuade investments — in trucking, in shipping, in warehouses, in technology — that might ease the supply chain upheaval.
