A four-year-old boy accidentally shot himself in the head and died after he found his dad's gun in the backseat of a car.

Jarion Walker was sitting in the back seat with his two younger siblings aged 22 months and one when tragedy struck in the city of Westwego near New Orleans, USA.

His mum was smoking weed in the front seat with another adult when the youngster picked up the weapon, according to authorities.

Jarion was rushed to hospital and died of his injuries after firing the gun at himself at around 10.45pm on Saturday.

An autopsy revealed that the gunshot wound was self-inflicted, according to Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto as reported by The New Orleans Advocate.

"It was a contact wound to the forehead, right above the right eyebrow," said Coroner Gerry Cvitanovich.

Police have not made any arrests but detectives confirmed that an investigation will take place.

Mr Lopinto said: "I don't think it was appropriate to make an arrest at this point.

"They just lost a child and it certainly wasn't intentional by any means."

It is understood that the boy found the gun underneath the seat, Mr Lopinto added.

Authorities said the weapon belonged to the youngster's father.

The Sheriff's Office is now warning gun owners to secure their firearms following the tragedy.

"Guns should never be left inside vehicles," the sheriff said.

“These types of deaths can certainly be prevented,” he added.

Residents of Louisiana can apply for a permit to conceal carry a gun from the age of 21.

Permit holders can carry firearms in Louisiana state parks, forests, and roadside rests.

A person's vehicle is one of the only places where Louisiana residents can carry a gun without a license or permit.

This applies to rifles and handguns.
