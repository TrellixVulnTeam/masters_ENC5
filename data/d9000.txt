RuPaul's Drag Race UK vs the World star Jimbo (BBC Three)

RuPaul’s Drag Race UK vs the World premiered with a mix of gag-worthy looks, eye-brow raising “talents” and shady comments for days as queens from five different spin-offs faced off against each other.

Fan-favourites from the UK, US, Thailand, Canada and the Netherlands competed to be named RuPaul’s next “global superstar”, as well as the chance to record a track with Mother Ru herself.

Baga Chipz, Cheryl Hole, and Blu Hydrangea were the Glamazon Warriors in contention against Drag Race Canada‘s Jimbo, Lemon, America’s Mo Heart and Jujubee, Holland’s Janey Jacké and Thailand’s Pangina Heals.

However, self-described “drag clown” Jimbo snatched wigs the most with her truly deranged Drag Race talent performance.

Spice Girl Melanie C joined RuPaul, Michelle Visage and Graham Norton on the judging panel as they witnessed what can only be described as the most insane performance in the show’s 13-year history.

Indeed, Jimbo ensured her first live performance in front of Ru would be one to remember as she rocked a white PVC ghost sperm outfit and revealed she has no talent.

So naturally, the only thing left to do was give birth to a stack of ham and fling it on herself, at her fellow queens and the judges.

Another highlight from this week’s Drag Race UK vs The World episode included Mel C throwing shade towards her fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham.

Speaking to Baga, she commented: “You are giving me lots of Spice Girl inspiration tonight. You lip synced badly, but when you were performing, I was like, there’s a resemblance.

“Posh Spice! But you know what, your vocals are ‘much betta.”

Here are more of the hilarious Twitter highlights from the premiere episode of Drag Race UK vs the World, episode one. Enjoy!
