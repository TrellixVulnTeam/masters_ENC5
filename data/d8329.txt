The club have confirmed Alex Telles, Fred and Edinson Cavani will likely miss their FA Cup meeting with Middlesbrough on Friday after their exploits in World Cup qualifiers for Brazil and Uruguay respectively.

Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw could be in contention again, alongside defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka after their recent absences. Jadon Sancho, meanwhile, has returned to training, as has Victor Lindelof.

Eric Bailly and Hannibal are both back from the Africa Cup of Nations, offering Ralf Rangnick a number of options. Still, having won two games on the spin prior to the recent break, perhaps the German will look to avoid rotating too much in order to keep some level of consistency.
