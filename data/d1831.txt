It is "not clear" if anything else will be added to a further report from Sue Gray, the Deputy Prime Minister has said despite cross-party demands from MPs.

Dominic Raab was speaking after yesterday's nine-page update by the top civil servant criticised "failures of leadership and judgment" at the heart of No 10 and Government.

"Anything she gives the Prime Minister he will publish but ultimately that's a question for Sue Gray and the timing will depend on the police investigation," the Deputy Prime Minister told LBC this morning.

On whether the full report would ever be released, Mr Raab said: "It's not clear to me that there is anything more, other than any conclusions that she will draw once that investigation is concluded, that will come forward."

It comes after Conservative backbenchers including Mark Harper, Julian Lewis and the usually loyal Andrew Jones called for Gray's full report to be published as soon as possible.
