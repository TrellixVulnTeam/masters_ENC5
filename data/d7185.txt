His comment prompted the official Twitter account of GCHQ to tweet a mocked-up graphic of the game with the word ‘sorry’ on it in response.

The playful exchange between the head of the UK’s foreign intelligence agency and its digital spy body comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the Ukraine over mounting concerns of a possible Russian invasion.

In the midst of the crisis, the head of MI6 indicated this morning that he is enjoying playing the hit game, which sees people given six attempts to guess a five letter word.

Players are then given clues about which letters they got right and if they were in the right place to help them solve the puzzle.

The game, which only releases one new word a day, has become an internet sensation with celebrities such as TV author and presenter Richard Osman and BBC anchor Dan Walker among its fans.

Expressing his frustration at those who reveal the answer before people are able to solve it themselves, Mr Moore tweeted: “Thinking of unfollowing those who post their #Wordle results…”

He then posted the GCHQ response to his feed.

The exchange prompted other users on Twitter to offer Mr Moore advice on how to avoid seeing the Wordle answer online, such as removing tweets with it from his feed.

Another user added: “I would hope you would know their results before they post them - kind of the point of your role.”

Meanwhile, the agency will be busy monitoring the build-up and movements of around 100,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.

Mr Johnson flew out to Kyiv yesterday in show of support to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, as the UK supplies the Eastern European nation with weapons ahead of any escalation in the conflict.
