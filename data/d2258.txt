Former President Donald Trump's sphere of influence reportedly has a staggering $122 million stashed away; a financial war-chest that could impact the outcome of elections for many Republican candidates.

The Trump-led Save America PAC has garnered more than 1.5 million donations by way of Facebook, text message marketing and other forms of solicitation.

A new report by Meridith Mcgraw, Alex Isenstadt and Scott Bland sheds light on the former president's "leadership PAC," breaking down the donations his organization has received — and how they could be used to advance his long-term political agenda.

Trump, Politico notes, has managed to harness the power of "small-dollar donors" who reportedly contributed most of the more than $100 million already raised by Save America. According to the report, Trump will likely harness that political support for a "comeback bid" in 2024 — though it cannot be used directly for a Trump presidential campaign.

"Most of the money — over $105 million — is in Save America PAC, which wouldn’t be able to transfer that money into a prospective future Trump campaign," Politico reports. "But the former president can spend it at will to affect the 2022 midterms, and his ability to raise so much money in the first place highlights his singular position in the GOP."

The funds are also being used to promote Republican candidates endorsed by the former president. In short, these are the candidates that have had no problem echoing his conspiratorial beliefs about the presidential election.

Trump-supporting political organizations have also benefited from the donations. "Out of $1.35 million the PAC spent on 'like-minded causes and endorsed candidates,' $1 million went to former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows’ new nonprofit organization, the Conservative Partnership Institute," they wrote.
