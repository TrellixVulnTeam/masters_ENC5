The Bafta-winning actor produced documentary President, which explores alleged vote-tampering by president Emmerson Mnangagwa over the 2018 election. It was not shown at last October’s festival. Newton later took back her claim.

Following the film’s subsequent success, which has included making the Oscars shortlist, Newton has said: “I’m just thinking London Film Festival, ‘Where were you?’

“The reason they weren’t there was because it was the week before Mnangagwa went to Scotland with 100 delegates from Zimbabwe, invited by the United Kingdom. That wouldn’t have been a great way to have him arrive the week before, right? That’s why I think it wasn’t screened,” Newton told Variety.

The Film Festival have denied the claims, saying: “Our selection decisions…are based on the merits of the film and whether it fits into the overall texture of the programme and not guided by external factors.”

Newton later apologised to the BFI for the claim, saying her “upset was personal, and I was wrong to accuse”.

LAURENCE FOX caused a stir last night when he announced he was taking a cocktail of drugs, including horse dewormer ivermectin, to combat his Covid. Ivermectin has been talked up by covid-conspiracists but has not been approved for use in treating coronavirus. Fox has come in for strong criticism, though we particularly enjoyed author William Sutcliffe’s view. He quipped: “Laurence Fox dosing himself with a medicine designed to destroy parasites feels like a very risky move on his part.”

SOPHIE ELLIS-BEXTOR knows how to capitalise on success. The singer, her husband and their five sons attracted audiences of millions during Covid lockdowns with their weekly parties in their kitchen. Now a cook book, Love. Food. Family: Recipes From the Kitchen Disco, jointly written by Ellis-Bextor and her husband Richard Jones is due in the summer alongside a tour to start in March. “Let’s put on the playlists, pour the cocktails and get stuck in,” the two say. Canny.

DAPPER PRESENTER Rick Edwards doesn’t look like a man in need of a wash, but appearances can be deceptive. The new presenter of the breakfast show on Radio 5Live, who has replaced Nicky Campbell, explains: “The other night I had gone to bed early… my wife had gone out and when she came in, I sort of vaguely woke up to find her lavender-spraying me and the rest of the bed.”

Edwards adds to the Fortunately podcast that his wife was “putting a fine mist over me because apparently I was really malodorous”. “It’s not,” he sighs, “a great way to be woken up.” Enough to cause a marital stink.

EMILY THORNBERRY had a strong start to Monday this morning. Journalist Kay Burley pressed the Labour frontbencher on Sky: “What’s the answer to my question?” Thornberry paused then replied: “I can’t remember what your question was”, before breaking into infectious laughter. Speaking for the nation.

FANCY working for Sir Geoffrey Cox QC? The former Attorney General is looking for a senior parliamentary assistant. Cox was last in the news for having spent a month in the British Virgin Islands doing his second job as a lawyer, and voting in Parliament by proxy. His advert doesn’t specify whether staff can work from home.

CAMOUFLAGE couldn’t stop us spotting actor — and son of Jude — Rafferty Law attending a private view by Alexander James in Shoreditch on Saturday night. Also there were model Sonny Hall, and fellow art fans Marta Marzi and Federica Labanca. More strikingly dressed — Leigh Bowery style — was singer Boy George at the London Palladium last night for the 20th anniversary of his musical Taboo, in aid of charities the Terrence Higgins Trust and Shelter.
