A grandad and a mum who had lain dead in a house for several weeks before they were found have been named.

The remains of Gary James, 57, and Louise Danks, 45, were found in the house in Redditch in October last year.

The pair were finally found by emergency services who had attended the house following concerns for their welfare.

Police enquiries are ongoing to establish how the pair died, Birmingham Live reported.

The families of Mr James and Ms Danks paid tribute to them, saying they would be missed.

Ellie, Ms Danks's daughter, said: “Nothing will ever take away our memories.

“My mom will be missed beyond measure by everyone she loved.”

Mr James’ son, Marcus, added of his father: “Gary was a loving dad and granddad and will be sadly missed by the whole family.

“You are free from all pain. Fly high.”

A West Mercia Police spokesperson said: "Anyone who has any information, or who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area between the end of September and mid-October, is urged to call 101 or visit www.westmerciapolice.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ quoting incident 403 of 28 October.

"Alternatively, if you have information but don’t feel comfortable speaking to police, you can speak to the independent charity Crimestoppers.

"It is 100 per cent anonymous, they never ask your name and they cannot trace your call or IP address. You can contact them online or by calling 0800 555 111."

Residents in the road where it happened spoke of their shock and sadness at the time.

One neighbour said last October: "The house was rented accommodation with residents frequently changing.

"The two people hadn't lived there for that long but kept themselves to themselves."
