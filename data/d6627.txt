The pathetic Canadian Prime Minister continues to attach hate-filled labels against ordinary working class Canadians who are protesting for the removal of COVID-19 mandates and restrictions.

These Alinsky attacks against his own countrymen are genuinely creepy and uncomfortable to see. Trudeau is continuing to melt down in a very public way. Other than a very small circle around him, I doubt these statements are generating much support.
