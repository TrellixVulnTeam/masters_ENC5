he 2022 Winter Olympics have arrived, with some early preliminary action getting underway on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony itself.

It feels like only yesterday that we were watching the action of an epic summer unfold in Tokyo, those Games delayed by a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but six months on all eyes are instead on Beijing.
