I've just finished up a rough draft of my The Right to Defy Criminal Demands article, and I thought I'd serialize it here, minus most of the footnotes (which you can see in the full PDF). I'd love to hear people's reactions and recommendations, since there's still plenty of time to edit it. You can also see all the posts here.

Criminals create risks for societyâ€”risks for their intended targets, and risks for bystanders. By defying criminals' demands, the criminals' victims may anger the criminals, and the criminals may respond by retaliating in ways that harm third parties.
