The Jackass brand seems indestructible, even if the testicles of the men on screen most assuredly are not. The stunt comedy show was launched by MTV in 2000, as a way for a nine-strong crew of daredevil lunatics, already in their mid-twenties, to monetise all the stupid, barely printable stuff they most wanted to do to one other.

There would be violently unsafe pranks, lots of meddling with dangerous animals, and an obsession with what’s quivering, in fear of some horrific new assault, in each man’s underwear. Perhaps bizarrely, this last fetish only seems to have intensified as this lot round their fifties.

Johnny Knoxville and his merry frat-boys, several of them conspicuously missing teeth by now, have already spun three films off from these activities – Jackass the Movie (2002), the pointedly named Jackass Number Two (2006), and Jackass 3D (2010). These have all kept the franchise ticking over, while necessitating heaven knows how many trips to hospital.

If they’d wanted to wax clever, Jackass Forever could have sported a silent “u” to signal it’s the fourth instalment; but cleverness, in the universe of Jackass, is not exactly the nature of the game. “This ain’t a Mensa convention!” helpfully declares one of the gang, before the world’s fastest softball pitcher unleashes one demon of a delivery into his friend’s padded crotch.

You would usually discourage any film from starting out with its most extreme, high-budget set piece, but Team Jackass don’t play by anyone’s bourgeois rules. So we’re treated to a lavish effects-movie pastiche with dozens of running and screaming extras in a downtown city location, which is molested not by Godzilla but – wait for it – a magnified penis in Godzilla cosplay.
