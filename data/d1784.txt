BROOKLYN Beckham has admitted he suffered an "embarrassing" blunder when he proposed to his fiancee Nicola.

David and Victoria's son says his other half "cried for five minutes" when he popped the question - leaving him hanging.

And as he tried to be romantic by presenting Nicola with her favourite wine, Brooklyn says he almost ruined the moment.

"I couldn't open up the wine, which was really embarrassing," he told James Corden on The Late Show.

"After 10 minutes, I finally opened it and poured her a glass and then I got on my knees. She didn't know what I was doing."

Host James joked that Nicola should have guessed what was about to happen after Brooklyn decorated a gazebo with flowers, candles before presenting wine and caviar.

But Brooklyn insists he treats Nicola like that "all the time".

He continued: "I got down on one knee and started telling her how much I love her, and it lasted like five minutes, and then I reached back and got the ring.

"I opened it and said 'will you marry me because I want to be with you for the rest of my life and you are my best friend' and she just started crying."

It made for a "nerve-wracking" wait as Nicola composed herself.

Brooklyn also told how his wife-to-be inspired several of his 84 tattoos.

"My fianc√© has gorgeous eyes so I thought why not," as he described one of them.

He also said his favourite was the inking of a love letter Nicola sent him.

The tattoo reads: "My forever boy read this anytime you feel anxious. I want you to know how deeply loved you are. You have the kindest heart I've ever met and I hope I never go a day without your love.

"I think you are so incredible just know we can get through it all together if you breathe slow and trust. I love you beyond. Love always, your future wife."
