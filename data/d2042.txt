SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — A woman and her husband have been arrested in the connection with the death of an 11-year-old boy at a Scottsdale hotel, police said Monday night.

They said 51-year-old Stephanie Marie Davis and 33-year-old Thomas James Desharnais were both jailed on suspicion of first-degree murder and two counts of child abuse.

Police said Davis was the boy’s biological grandmother and was being held on a $3.5 million cash bond while Desharnais' cash bond was set at $1.5 million.

It was unclear Monday night if either Davis or Desharnais has a lawyer yet who can speak om their behalf about the case.

Police said they received a call about a juvenile who was unresponsive and not breathing around 5 p.m. Sunday.

They say the boy had “significant injuries” and was transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

His name wasn’t immediately released by police, who didn't provide any information on how the boy may have died.
