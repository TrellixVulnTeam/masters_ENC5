CONTROLS on drinking in the street could be extended in a bid to cut down on anti-social behaviour in Southampton.

Southampton City Council is currently consulting with residents on plans to extend controls on alcohol consumption in public for a further three years.

The Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPOs) give police powers to tackle street drinking, allowing them to seize and dispose of any alcohol being consumed within a designated area.

Measures can last for up to three years, but after this point it must be reviewed, after which it can be extended for up to three years.

Under the council's plans, measures would be extended for three years from 2022 in Bitterne, Portswood, Shirley, Woolston and the city centre.

Councillor Spiros Vassiliou, Cabinet Member for Communities, Culture & Heritage said: “We know from working with Hampshire Constabulary, and the feedback we receive from members of the public, that street drinking remains a problem in commercial centres and public parks.

"Anti-social behaviour is a complex issue, and the Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) is one of the tools used by police officers and our community safety teams to tackle activities that adversely affects communities, the environment, and businesses in the city.

"Now is the time to have your say on whether to extend the controls on street drinking for a further three years.”

Measures can also see officers direct individuals to stop drinking alcohol in an area covered by a PSPO and those who fail to comply can be hit with a £100 fixed penalty or prosecution.

A survey has now been launched on the city council website for residents to have their say on the proposals.

A council spokesperson said: "We are interested to hear about any ways in which the proposals could affect you or others and any alternatives you feel we should consider."

The survey is open until February 18 and can be completed at: https://www.southampton.gov.uk/pspo-2022/
