Shockingly, Canadian Prime Minister Just Trudeau accused the trucker convoy protest of anti-madate, anti-vaxers of racial hatred and violence.

He made the defamatory statements from a secret location that he has fled to, as he fears being asked to explain his policies to the public.

The reaction to this speaks volumes of those who do not understand the problem.

Trudeau isn’t scared. He’s mocking you. He’s fully vaccinated, but somehow gets Covid right when the truckers show up to Ottawa, refusing to entertain the thought of meeting them or any sort of compromise. Then he is evacuated. Twice. Rumor is that he is in Berlin. He will wait this out while rubbing salt in the wound.

Trudeau and the parasites behind him believe they are better than these truckers. That they’re not worth representing in any fashion or even listening to. He’s willing to let Canada starve and his own sycophantic supporters suffer just to rub it in the face of the rural White working class that they do not matter.

Even the elitist devotion to the Covid death cult gets exposed here as nothing but a naked power grab, a bludgeon to protect and expand the power of the managerial class pushing the Great Reset at any cost. Trudeau is even mocking those who have been vaccinated with this move. The message is clear: no one matters but the elite and their stranglehold on power.

At the end of the day, the answer to the mess the West is in is lots of rope and the will to use it.
