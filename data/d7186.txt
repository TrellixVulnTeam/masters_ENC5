For many of us, our workwear gives us just the boost we need to stride into the office each morning with confidence.

But, to be frank, fashion often has very little to do with what’s appropriate for work. Streetwear-influenced trainers and a grunge-y satin slip may win you style points among friends, but they’ll do you no favours in a corporate environment. There are times, no matter how much you love a trend, when professionalism has to prevail and your beloved Balenciaga Triple S trainers must stay at home.

But that doesn’t mean great workwear can’t be interesting or stylish. In fact, the retail landscape has never been more inspiring for those who expect both fashion cred and office-friendliness from their clothes.

Take the trend for sharp tailoring and power suits, or polished, ladylike frame bags. But for every perfect piece on the rail, there’s a printed midi dress with an inappropriately high slit, or bra-exposing backless detail.

Here, the Telegraph fashion team navigates the minefield to reveal their go-to stores, as we plan for our eventual office return.
