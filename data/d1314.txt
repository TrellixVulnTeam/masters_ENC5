This Morning fans were delighted today as Gok Wan introduced his parents on the show today.

The fashion guru-turned-chef, 47, appeared on the ITV show as he cooked up a feast ahead of the Chinese New Year.

But Gok ended up being surprised by his parents, who appeared via video link as they said hello to their son.

And fans couldn't believe how much of likeness there was between Gok and his mum and flocked to Twitter to comment.

One tweeted: "How much does Gok look like his mother tho! #ThisMorning."

While another wrote: "Gok's the double of his mother."

A third commented: "Gok is more like his mum."

"#thismorning What a lovely matter-of-fact woman Gok’s mother is. Refreshing," another tweeted.

It comes after Gok opened up about taking up the Couch to 5K programme to get fit during lockdown last year.

The TV star, who hosted How to Look Good Naked and Gok’s Fashion Fix, had spoken about he reached 21 stone when he worked in his family's Chinese restaurant in Leicester.

Appearing on This Morning in 2019, he explained: “We loved our food. We had a restaurant, food was the epicentre of life.

“We were fine, it was everyone else who had a problem with the way we looked.

“It wasn’t until I was 21 stone and moved to London to go to drama school that I saw people looked very different to me."

The star, at one point, lost 11 stone in only eight months when his eating disorder was at its worst during drama school.

He has since developed a healthier relationship with both food and his body.
