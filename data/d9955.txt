PIERRE-EMERICK AUABMEYANG has finally been announced by Barcelona.

But it is not guaranteed that he will be able to play a part in his new club's Europa League campaign.

Under Uefa rules, Barca can only register three of their four January signings to participate in the competition.

Arsenal only brought in one player on deadline day - American defender Auston Trusty.

Trusty will be loaned back to MLS side Colorado Rapids, who share the same owner as the Gunners, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment.

And we've got the latest on Alexandre Lacazette's future, with former side Lyon eyeing the striker.
