GREENWICH — Local police say they are making progress on reducing the number of stolen cars after a wave of thefts has plagued the community in recent years.

There has been a roughly 30 percent decline in the number of stolen cars from 2020 to 2021, according to police Capt. Mark Zuccerella.

The department recorded 85 stolen cars in 2021, and 130 the year before, which was a record, he said. Larcenies from motor vehicle have also been reduced in similar numbers, Zuccerella said.

The number of stolen cars has been trending downward, although the problem persists, police said.

Two police officers working the overnight shift were recently commended for disrupting attempted car thefts in Greenwich. Police Chief James Heavey credited Officers Jeff Franco and Frank Solomon with “excellent” police work, according to a recent statement from the department.

“Good police work,” said Zuccerella. “They had some good ideas and some good instincts” in finding out where and how car thieves were likely to be operating.

“It’s not uncommon for them to stop three or four thefts a night; they’re disrupting it,” he said, noting that the problem of car thefts is not confined to just Greenwich.

“They’re two distinct groups doing this, juveniles from the state of Connecticut, and professional crews, from the New York and New Jersey area,” he said of the rash of vehicle thefts in recent years.

The criminal trend has been exacerbated by local residents who leave their keys inside their cars with the doors unlocked, Zuccerella said. “Public awareness” had been raised by police, and more residents are getting the message about stopping preventable crime by taking in their keys and locking their vehicles, he said.

Smash-and-grab thefts from vehicles at local parks and golf clubs have also been a problem in recent months, and police are cautioning motorists not to leave valuables in plain sight when they visit parks and other public areas.

Despite the downturn, number of cars had recently been stolen in downtown Greenwich, where motorists were leaving keys inside their vehicles, police said.

Stolen cars are often used in the commission of other crimes, and can put other motorists, pedestrians and police responders in danger, police said.

Debate among lawmakers in Hartford has been ongoing over how what penalties young offenders should face for car thefts and whether the current legislation is too lenient. The death of a jogger in New Britain by an alleged car thief in June 2021 heightened attention around the issue.
