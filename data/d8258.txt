The 24-year-old has been on international duty with Uruguay and while he is likely to arrive at the club on Thursday, he won’t be able to join in with training until he gets a work permit.

When the time comes, Bentancur knows he will be worked hard by his new manager as he gave Tottenham fans a taste of what he hopes to bring to the team.

“I would say I’m a very tactical player who covers free spaces, does well when winning the ball back and moves it forward quickly,” Bentancur told Tottenham’s official website.

“I also think I have scope to improve even more and I can do so as part of this team at Spurs.

“I am looking forward to learning from Antonio Conte – I think he’s a great coach, he wants to win and gets 150 per cent out of his players. I think he’ll make me improve even more, both mentally and as a player. I like that, and it’s a big motivation for me.”

Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, who also arrived from Juventus on deadline day, are the first signings of the Conte era at Tottenham and will hope to help their new club in a push for the top four.

Kulusevski has spoken about how he has always wanted to play in the Premier League, and it’s a similarly exciting prospect for Bentancur.

“It’s a great club with great players – always competing in all competitions,” Bentancur said.

“I was very happy when I heard about the interest in me and thankfully I’ve joined now.

“It’s a huge pleasure and an honour to be able to represent this shirt. As I said, it’s a brilliant club and a great league that I’ve always liked and now I’m going to have the chance to enjoy it alongside the other great players that we have.

“I think they’ll help me to grow a lot on a footballing level, and obviously we’ll always try to give everything we can to represent the club together.”
