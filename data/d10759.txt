“They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,” he said.

Rogan is estimated to have around 11 million listeners per episode of his “Joe Rogan Show” podcast. It is consistently No. 1 on Spotify’s podcast charts. (Trump’s show does not appear in the Top 100.) He has promoted false statements about vaccines and COVID-19 cures and often hosts guests who do the same.

In January, 270 scientists, doctors, health care workers and professors signed an open letter slamming Rogan as “a menace to public health” and calling on Spotify to establish a misinformation policy. Spotify announced Sunday that it would add content advisories to any podcast episode that discusses COVID-19. Critics have said that the move — details of which remain unclear — is not enough.
