At least 24 people have been killed in a landslide in Ecuador.

Torrential rain on Monday – the worst for 20 years – caused a buildup of water in a gorge, which then sent mud sweeping down through the streets of the capital, Quito.

Residents described an “immense black river” dragging along everything in its path.
