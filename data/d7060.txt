A professor from the State University of New York at Fredonia actually says in the video below that he doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with an adult man wanting to have sex with a 12-year-old girl.

This professor even goes as far as saying that it’s not obvious to him that sex with a one-year-old is necessarily wrong. He ends his comment by saying “but no I don’t think it’s blanket wrong at any age”.

This professor, Stephen Kershnar, authored a book in 2015 called “Pedophilia and Adult–Child Sex: A Philosophical Analysis.” So this isn’t anything new. From what I can tell, he’s also an atheist who probably believes in moral relativism. Shocker.

SUNY at Fredonia calls him a “distinguished teaching professor in the philosophy department”, so they must know and approve of all of this. Absolutely unbelievable.
