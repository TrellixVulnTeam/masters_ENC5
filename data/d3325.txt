Strictly Come Dancing star Dan Walker couldnâ€™t resist a cheeky dig at Boris Johnson, as he joked that he and his pro partner Nadiya Bychkova were â€˜ambushedâ€™ with a cake while out for dinner.

The BBC Breakfast host, 44, enjoyed a night out with the dancer and his fellow Strictly co-stars in Danâ€™s favourite curry house, the Prithiraj restaurant in Sheffield.

Taking to Instagram, Dan shared a group picture alongside his co-stars Rhys Stephenson, Tilly Ramsay, Nikita Kuzmin, Janette Manrara, Kai Widdrington, and even Mr Nasty Craig Revel Horwood joined them.

The star also took a moment to give the dining spot a shout-out after they surprised him and Nadiya with a personalised cake.

â€˜Ohâ€¦ I forgot to sayâ€¦ thanks for the cake too,â€™ Dan wrote.

â€˜So kind of you @prithiraj_restaurant ðŸŽ‚ðŸ¤©ðŸŽ‚ By the wayâ€¦ @nadiyabychkova and I did share it around ðŸ˜‹ #AmbushedByACake.â€™

The dig was in reference to the Prime Minister who claimed he was taken by surprise by a baked birthday treat while speaking about alleged parties in Downing Street.

The Strictly gang, which includes series winner Rose Ayling- Ellis, John Whaite, and Maisie Smith, are currently delighting audiences across the country with their performances on the live tour.

Rumours have recently been swirling around the supposed romance between pros Nadiya and Kai, following the formerâ€™s recent split from her fiancÃ©.

The pair were spotted kissing in new photos, following reports that they had been â€˜dating for monthsâ€™.

Elsewhere, professional dancer Amy Dowden was forced to miss the first few shows and later shared a candid selfie on Instagram, as she gave her followers an insight into life with a chronic illness.

Strictly Come Dancing is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.
