Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from a neighborhood in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Tuesday as the authorities warned of a possible explosion from a fire burning for a second day at a nearby fertilizer plant.

More than 600 tons of ammonium nitrate were at the Winston Weaver Company plant when the fire broke out on Monday night, the city’s fire chief, Trey Mayo, said in a news conference on Tuesday. He compared it to a fire at a fertilizer plant in Texas in 2013, in which 240 tons of the same product exploded, destroying or severely damaging nearly 200 homes and killing 15 people.

“If that doesn’t convey the gravity of the situation and how serious folks need to take it,” he said, “I don’t know how else to verbalize that.”

Asked by a reporter how much of the chemical was “in the line of fire” on Tuesday, Chief Mayo said, “all of it.”
