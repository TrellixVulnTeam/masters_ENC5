It is the dog that has come to symbolise Britain's fighting spirit and no-nonsense attitude. But a court in Norway on Monday ruled that breeding British Bulldogs should be illegal in the country, effectively banning the historic breed.

In a landmark ruling, Oslo Discrict Court ruled that breeding the dog contravened the country’s Animal Welfare Act, effectively banning the dog in the country.

“This is first and foremost a victory for our dogs," said Åshild Roaldset, the vet who leads Animal Protection Norway, the animal rights group which took the case to court.

"It is a historic verdict that attracts international attention. The man-made health problems of the bulldog have been known since the early 20th century. But dogs have the right to be bred healthy."

The group's legal team argued successfully for a ban on breeding both British Bulldogs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, arguing that the history of selective breeding meant that there are currently no animals in Norway that could be classed as "healthy" and so ethically be used for breeding.

Due to their short and wide skulls and short snouts, British bulldogs are prone to Brachycephalic Airway Obstruction Syndrome, and a range of other health problems.

Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, meanwhile, suffer heart defects, headaches, and eye and joint problems.

The popularity of flat-faced dogs has grown in recent years, with The Kennel Club reporting a 2,747 per cent rise in ownership in the last 17 years. Owners often do not realise their pets are in pain.
