Democrats are apparently trying to resurrect their dead Build Back Better bill, or at least parts of it. McConnell was asked about it this morning:

Buried indeed. Joe Manchin was asked about it as well and he said he’s not had any talks because the bill is ‘dead’.

There you have it and that’s good news. But I suspect that parts of that bill will still reemerge this year with a new name: Omnibus.

It should suffer the same fate if it’s anything like the reckless Build Back Better bill, so I’m not all that worried.
