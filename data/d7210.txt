To help provide you with some peace of mind, Uniworld offers a comprehensive travel protection plan.

You can count on the value of Uniworldâ€™s experience and regional knowledge to make sure you enjoy your cruise/tour even when conditions beyond our control occur. The very nature of a river, its sources, and networks of bridges and locks, means that there will be times when weather or other conditions in a region require Uniworld to make adjustments and/or modifications to an itinerary. Although every effort will be made to keep itineraries, vessels, and hotels as they are shown in the brochure, Uniworld reserves the right to substitute itineraries, hotels or vessels. In such cases, we will do everything we can to make sure the locations visited, the excursions taken and the hotels or vessels offered are similar to the ones originally planned. Any changes to itineraries will not result in eligibility for a refund. Itineraries are subject to change without notice and may need to be altered specifically because of water levels, wind factors, or other conditions.

Uniworld reserves the right to reschedule and/or cancel land extensions or land tours if the minimum number of participants (20 people) is not met or for safety reasons. If you, as the Passenger, choose to cancel your pre- or post-cruise extension eighty-nine (89) days or less before departure, then please refer to the Cancellation Policy section for the applicable cancellation policy and penalties that will be applied.

Uniworld reserves the right to cancel, advance or postpone any scheduled sailing date and may, but is not obligated to, substitute hotels or vessels. Uniworld shall not be liable for any loss to you by reason of any such cancellation, advancement or postponement. In the event of cancellation by Uniworld, your sole right of recourse shall be to obtain a refund of monies paid to Uniworld in connection with such cruise/tour.
