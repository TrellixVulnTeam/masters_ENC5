amuel Little, a man described by the FBI as the most prolific serial killer in US history surpassing the likes of Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy, has died aged 80.

Mr Little, who confessed to having committed 93 murders between 1970 and 2005, died in a California hospital on Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.

He was serving a life sentence for the murder of three women in the 1980s at a state prison in Los Angeles County since 2014.

Although The Associated Press reported that Mr Little had diabetes, heart trouble and other unspecified ailments, no cause of death has yet been determined for the former competitive boxer.

Some of his victims were young black women on the margins of society. Many were originally thought to have died from drug overdoses or accidentally but some of their bodies were never found.

Last year the FBI released videos of prison interviews with Little. In one he told how he strangled a woman in 1993 and then rolled her body down a slope on a deserted road.

The FBI said investigators have since verified 50 of his confessions, with many more pending final confirmation, making him the deadliest US serial killer on record.
