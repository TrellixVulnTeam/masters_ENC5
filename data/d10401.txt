Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Tuesday grilled Joe Biden’s far-left nominee to be judge of the Central District of California.

Cruz simply asked Kenly Kiya Kato if racial discrimination is wrong and she couldn’t answer the question.

Senator Cruz also asked Kenly Kiya Kato if she’s concerned that top law schools are brazenly discriminating against Asian-Americans.

Last year Biden’s DOJ notified a federal judge that it is dropping a race-based discrimination lawsuit against Yale University.

Trump’s Department of Justice opened an investigation into Yale in 2018 in response to a complaint alleging Yale discriminates against Asians in its admission process.

In summer 2020, a Justice Department investigation found that Yale University illegally discriminates against Asian Americans and White Americans in undergraduate admissions in violation of civil-rights law.

“Yale’s race discrimination imposes undue and unlawful penalties on racially-disfavored applicants, including in particular Asian American and White applicants.”

“For example, the likelihood of admission for Asian American and White applicants who have similar academic credentials is significantly lower than for African American and Hispanic applicants to Yale College. For the great majority of applicants, Asian American and White applicants have only one-tenth to one-fourth of the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials.”

Yale celebrated the dismissal of the high-profile case and bragged about its systemic racism in a statement.

“Our admissions process has allowed Yale College to assemble an unparalleled student body, which is distinguished by its academic excellence and diversity. Yale has steadfastly maintained that its process complies fully with Supreme Court precedent, and we are confident that the Justice Department will agree,” it said in a written statement.
