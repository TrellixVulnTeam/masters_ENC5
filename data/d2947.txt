House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman has continued to pay her daughter with campaign cash – and has already broken the seven-figure mark.

Since 2003, Karen Waters has received over $1 million in payments from her mother to her and her company, Progressive Connections, for campaign-related services.

Federal Elections Commission (FEC) data reviewed by Fox News Digital shows the payments range from the hundreds to the tens of thousands of dollars for a variety of costs, including "slate mailer management" fees, "campaign managing services," and paying for a "band for [a] holiday event."

MAXINE WATERS PAID DAUGHTER $74,000 IN CAMPAIGN CASH THIS YEAR ALONE

The add up, with the showing that the congresswoman has paid her daughter and Progressive Connections over $1.2 million since 2003.

Waters’ campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

The recurring financial windfall funneling from Waters’ campaign to her daughter’s coffers is a staple feature of the congresswoman’s career in office.

Slate-mailing is an uncommon practice in federal elections, where a consulting firm is hired to create a pamphlet of sorts that contains a list of candidates or policy measures, and advises voters how to cast their ballots.

Rep. Waters was reportedly the only federal politician to use a slate-mailer operation during the 2020 general election.

Other members of the Waters clan have also made off with donor cash over the course of the congresswoman’s decades-long career.

In 2004, the Los Angeles Times revealed that the Waters campaign had shelled out over $1 million to other family members over the previous eight years.
