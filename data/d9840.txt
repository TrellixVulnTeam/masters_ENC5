There’s a lot of discussion on Twitter about Zucker’s resignation from CNN this morning, but Ben Shapiro’s tweet caught my eye.

Zucker was nailing Gollust who used to work for Andrew Cuomo. Zucker was paying Chris who was working for Andrew. CNN spent all of 2020 painting Andrew as the greatest governor in the country while he shoveled covid+ elderly into nursing homes, then covered it up.

BUT WHY DO THE PEOPLE TRUST ROGAN MORE THAN CNN?!?!?!?!!!?! pic.twitter.com/teJkXHbP4J

CNN: 

– Until today, employed Jeff Zucker, who covered for Cuomo to hide his own affair.

– Formerly employed two producers who are now charged with child sex crimes.

– Currently employs Jeffrey Toobin.

So spare me the pearl-clutching about Joe Rogan's credibility.
