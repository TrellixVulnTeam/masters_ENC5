Feb. 1 (UPI) -- NASA has released details of the International Space Station's transition plan, including destruction of the structure in 2031, and research goals for the interim and the future.

The ISS will deorbit in January 2031 ahead of crashing it into an uninhabited area of the South Pacific Ocean near to Point Nemo, which has been called a "spacecraft cemetery," according to the updated plan that NASA released Monday.
