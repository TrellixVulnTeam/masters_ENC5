Alejandro Ortiz, 27, said he flew from Zacatecas, Mexico, into Midway Airport in October on a tourist visa to see his family, but officials did not accept it and took him into custody. He said that he has some issues in Mexico he didn’t want to talk about, but had come on a tourist visa before and didn’t anticipate any problem.
