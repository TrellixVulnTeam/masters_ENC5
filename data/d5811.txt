Police were called to reports of a “disturbance” at a home in Tennyson Rd, at 4pm on Tuesday.

Despite the efforts of paramedics a woman was pronounced dead at the scene, Essex Police said.

Her family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers. Essex Police forensics are still guarding the scene where a woman was found.

Her cause of death is yet to be established.

A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.

Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Scott Egerton, said: “We are at the early stages of our investigation and are working to build a picture of what happened yesterday.

“This incident took place in a residential area so I know it’s likely to cause concern for those living nearby but we have made a quick arrest and do not believe there is a risk to the wider public.

“There will continue to be a visible police presence in the area throughout today.

“If you have any concerns or any information please come and speak to one of our officers.”
