On Monday shameless Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau smeared the tens of thousands of Canadian truckers and their supporters who were protesting his tyrannical COVID policies.

Trudeau accused the truckers of “racism” and said they were using “Nazi symbolism”.

Following his remarks the conservative Canadian lawmakers destroyed the far-left leader hiding in his bunker from working-class Canadians.



Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party in Canada, Candice Bergen, brutally rips the cowardly Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, for slandering the freedom convoy as racist.

Conservative lawmaker Pierre Poilievre then argued it’s not fair to call all Liberals racist because Justin Trudeau does blackface.
