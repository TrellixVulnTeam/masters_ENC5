Polyphenols may be an effective therapy for both the prevention and treatment of cancer. Previous studies have found that these compounds may inactive Hela cells, which may even be converted into a normal cells post-treatment. The present study extracted phenolic compounds from pomegranate peel, with the polyphenols then purified using different solvents and identified by means of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS). Once the phenolic compounds had been purified, we evaluated their cytotoxic effects on both the Hela and NIH-3T3 cell lines, on which an apoptosis assay was also carried out. Additionally, apoptosis assay was carried out on Hela and NIH-3T3. Lastly, the proteome profile was analysed via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). We isolated and then purified punicalagin and ellagic acid (EA) from pomegranate peel, with both compounds likely to have a cytotoxic effect on Hela and NIH-3T3. However, this effect depends on both concentration and exposure time. Results obtained using a Cayman commercial assay kit suggests that punicalin and EA regulate the apoptosis on the Hela and NIH-3T3 cell lines. Finally, we observed that polyphenols compounds regulate the expression of proteins related to apoptosis. In conclusion, punicalin and EA have a cytotoxic effect on Hela and, furthermore, reactive the apoptotic pathway in this cell.
