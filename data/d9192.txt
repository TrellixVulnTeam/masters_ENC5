Hundreds of demonstrators surrounded the Pfizer headquarters in Paris on Saturday, calling French President Emmanuel Macron and Pfizer "assassins" while demanding the end of COVID-19 mandates.On January 24, Covid regulations reached a new level of tyranny when the country's vaccine pass measure went into effect.Prior to the implementation of the new health pass law, unvaccinated citizens could opt to present a negative COVID test in lieu of proof of vaccination to access certain premises.Last month, Macron "promised" to antagonize the unvaccinated until they comply with Covid regulations."The unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And so, we're going to continue doing so, until the end. That's the strategy," the French president told reporters recently., the administrative director of the public hospital network of the Paris region, APHP, is also taking measures to penalize the unvaccinated. Last week,"I don't want to close the door of the hospital and of care to anyone, but you have to be allied with the responsibility that allows everyone to benefit from it," he said.
