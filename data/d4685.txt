BBC Three is back on television. It has an £80 million budget and the pre-publicity promised a menu of “exciting, groundbreaking content”. So why did its launch night have all the freshness of a stale loaf?

A double bill from the fourth series of Eating With My Ex; a documentary that has been available on iPlayer for a week; repeats of Fleabag. Did that £80 million fall down the back of a filing cabinet? The BBC assures us that new shows are in the pipeline, including an adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel Conversations with Friends. But it is baffling that the channel has chosen to kick off with a line-up this weak.

There was a sort-of-new show in the shape of RuPaul’s Drag Race vs The World, a global upgrade on Drag Race UK. The original is popular, so this is likely to be a hit. And a new all-female sketch show, Lazy Susan, starring Freya Parker and Celeste Dring, which has potential but is nowhere near as funny as Smack the Pony (now over 20 years old). Then again, I would say that, wouldn’t I? I’m old. BBC Three’s target audience were toddlers when Smack the Pony was on air.

Yet, whatever your age, the launch night was thin gruel. The first episode of Eating With My Ex (a show that belongs on ITV2) was a “celebrity special” featuring two wannabes whose relationship had lasted a grand total of one day while appearing on a Netflix reality show called Too Hot To Handle. The cynicism of it all was staggering.

The lack of effort put into the scheduling gets more evident as this week goes on, with repeats of This Country and Killing Eve. By Friday, the channel gives up completely, screening eight – eight! – back-to-back repeats of Angels of the North, a 2019 series about a hair salon in the north east.
