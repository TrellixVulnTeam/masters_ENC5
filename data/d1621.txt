Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said President Biden's pledge to nominate an African American female as a Supreme Court justice is "offensive" because it's essentially a message to 94% of Americans that they're "ineligible" for such a position.

"I have to say that's offensive. Black woman are what, 6% of the U.S. population? He's saying to 94% of Americans, 'I don't give a damn about you. You are ineligible.' And he's also saying, it's actually an insult to black women," Cruz said during a video interview posted to his Twitter account on Sunday evening.

"If you came and said, 'I'm going to put the best jurist on the court' and he looked at a number of people and ended up nominating a black woman he could credibly say, 'OK, I'm nominating the person who is most qualified.' He's not even pretending to say that. He's saying, 'If you're a white guy, tough luck. If you're a white woman, tough luck. You don't qualify,'" he added.

As an example, Cruz said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland is "out" of the running for the spot because he has the wrong skin color and sex.

"It's an example how Democrats, particularly the far left, everything is race, they will discriminate based on race, they will pigeonhole you," he said. "They don't care about the individual."
