WALTON COUNTY, Fla— A man suspected of manufacturing child porn in his DeFuniak Springs home was taken into custody after coming face-to-face with law enforcement armed with a shotgun.

The Walton County Sheriff’s Office Special Victim’s Unit executed a search warrant on December 16th at 7105 Rock Hill Road following a tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

The suspect, Marty Scott Bass, 57, came to the door holding a shotgun during the initiation of the search warrant. When given multiple commands by WCSO SWAT team members, Bass put the weapon down and was quickly detained.

During the execution of the search warrant, Bass’s cellphone was located and forensically downloaded and evaluated. Investigators learned the device contained 100 plus images of child pornography, some of which were produced by Bass of children 8 – 10 years of age.

In addition to the child porn found on Bass’s phone, a secret bunker was also located during the search warrant. The bunker’s entrance was disguised as a bench located in the shed adjacent to the home. When lifting the bench, a hole was located leading underground.

Deputies did not say what was found in the bunker, if anything.

Bass was arrested and charged with 100 counts of possession of child pornography and 10 counts of the production of child pornography.
