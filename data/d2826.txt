Both the DP World Tour and the PGA Tour reluctantly granted permission for players to compete in the event, which is sponsored by the Saudi public investment fund, though they expect future commitments in return.

The huge appearances fees have attracted a star-studded field, with Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau and Xander Schauffele among those arriving from the US, while Tommy Fleetwood, Tyrrell Hatton and Sergio Garcia lead the European contingent.

Two-time major winner Greg Norman is the face of Saudi investment in the Asian Tour and has promised there is more to come as he looks to threaten the dominance of the established bodies.

“In the beginning, we have to get off with baby steps, understand where we need to go and how we’re going to need to do it,” Norman said.

“This is just the infancy of this journey, and it’s really going to be an exciting journey.”

What comes next for the Asian Tour, and whether it can tempt players away from the PGA Tour and DP World Tour longer-term, remains to be seen, but for now the focus in on the Saudi International this week, taking place in King Abdullah Economic City.

The first round of the Saudi International gets underway early on Thursday, February 3, before the winner lifts the trophy after Sunday’s final round in the early afternoon UK time.
