Blantyre store Premier Mo's have once again provided bags of essentials for local families in need.

The shop, on 190 Main Street, hung bags of clothes and winter coats on the railings at Blantyre Miners Welfare to help anyone in the area struggling to make ends meet.

The bags contained essential items of warm clothing and people were encouraged to pop along and help themselves with - importantly - no judgement.

It's not the first time shop owner and local councillor Mo Razzaq, and his wife Roxy, have helped members of their community, regularly hanging up bags of food on the same railings to make sure people in the area do not go hungry.

The couple are also known for their generous donations to local charities and schools.

Generous Mo told Lanarkshire Live : "On Friday morning we placed bags of clothes including jackets outside Blantyre Miners Welfare.

"We simply wrote on the bags the sizes of the items for help and encouraged people to please take what they needed.

"Thank you to everyone who donated and also to the kind gentleman who donated £40 towards our next food bag initiative."

He added: "We will do our utmost to have more bags placed regularly as we are firm believers that no family should be going hungry or cold but unfortunately this is the case."
