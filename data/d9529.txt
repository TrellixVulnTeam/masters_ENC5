In a viral video, an angry man who seems to be a member of the “mass formation psychosis” cult was seen screaming at the truck drivers who were protesting against Trudeau’s unconstitutional vaccine mandate.

At the beginning of the video, you can see the man demanding the truck drivers “get out of his city.” Then he continued asking the driver what freedom have you lost. According to him, he lost his mind for not sleeping for 5 days.

“What f**king freedom have you lost? Tell me a freedom you’ve lost. I lost my mind because I haven’t slept for 5 days,” the leftist man said.

“It has to stop,” he added.

One of the truck drivers responded, “Then it stops when the government lifts the mandates.”

“You f**king id**t. The mandates are provincial, not federal. If you’re mad about wearing a mask or getting a f**king vaccine, go talk to Doug Ford. The Prime Minister has nothing to do with it,” the leftist man argued frantically.

“Actually, he does,” the truck driver said. “Didn’t the federal government make vaccine mandates for all federal employees?” the driver continued.

“It’s a requirement for your f**king job,” the leftist man said.

“Yeah, exactly, that’s part of the mandate man,” the driver responded.

Another truck driver was heard calling the leftist man a “Karen.”

“The honking will continue until freedom improves. Simple as that. Simple as that. Join us,” the driver concluded.
