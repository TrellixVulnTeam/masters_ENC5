A Democrat, who oversees the nation’s housing and financial services sectors, strangely gave a family member large sums of cash.

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) recently caught Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.) giving more than US$1 million in campaign money to her daughter.

According to data published on the regulator’s website, the House Financial Services Committee chairwoman gradually transferred the sum over 18 years to Karen Waters and her family business Progressive Connections.

The amounts are described as “slate mailer”, “holiday” event, and fundraising management fees according to disbursements declared by the Citizens for Waters organization.

Fox News estimates relevant amounts declared since 2003 could total more than US$1.2 million.

“Slate-mailing is an uncommon practice in federal elections, where a consulting firm is hired to create a pamphlet of sorts that contains a list of candidates or policy measures, and advises voters how to cast their ballots,” Fox digital editors Houston Keene and Cameron Cawthorne reported.

“Rep. Waters was reportedly the only federal politician to use a slate-mailer operation during the 2020 general election,” they added.

Waters’s campaign team did not respond to the broadcaster’s request for comment at the time of publication.
