Wales won last year's title in a thrilling finish that was thrown into chaos by a covid outbreak.

France's third match against Scotland had to be rescheduled for after the final round of fixtures.

The French side beat Wales 32-30 with two late tries at the Stade de France and looked on course for the title.

They had to beat Scotland by 21 points in the rearranged finale the following week to leapfrog Wales in the Six Nations table.

But a late try from Duhan van der Merwe gave Scotland a famous victory in Paris and handed Wales the title.
