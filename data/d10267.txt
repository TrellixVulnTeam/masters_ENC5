What’s remarkable about the end of his tenure in office, really, is that he didn’t pardon those accused of crimes related to the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He extended clemency to everyone who had been rolled up in the Russia investigation, ensuring that, for example, Paul Manafort, Stephen K. Bannon and Roger Stone could all walk free. He was not shy about any of it, making the fact that he turned his back on those alleged rioters all the more obvious.
