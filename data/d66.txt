PIERS Morgan has waded into the row between Spotify and Meghan & Harry after the couple demanded the platform remove podcaster Joe Rogan.

Last week US musician Neil Young removed his music from the platform in protest at it hosting content by podcast superstar Joe Rogan that contained disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.

Young was followed by singer Joni Mitchell who removed her music in solidarity with Young, triggering a wave of debate about whether other high profile figures - including Prince Harry & Duchess of Sussex - would remove their songs as well.

Rogan's podcast 'The Joe Rogan Experience' is easily the most-popular show on Spotify after he joined in a £100m deal, but he has repeatedly been accused of using it to encourage his "fit and healthy" fans not to get the vaccine.

In a column for The Sun, Piers said: “In a new low, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have demanded the Swedish streaming platform — which paid them $25 million last year to do their own podcast — do something about Rogan’s 'rampant misinformation.'

“Sorry, WHAT? A pair of two-bit minor British royal family renegades best known for spewing outrageously harmful misinformation to Oprah Winfrey are trying to suppress an American’s First Amendment right to free speech?”

"How dare she and her equally hypocritical husband, Harry, make any demands from a company that’s paid them a fortune to so far produce one podcast that was so bad, I needed urgent brain cell restoration surgery after enduring it?

"If the choice of whom to listen to in America is a curious, smart man who listens to myriad views to get to the truth, or a pair of fork-tongued, woke wastrels whose only currency is trashing the royal institution that gave them their titles to exploit for vast financial gain, give me the former anytime."
