POKIMANE is being accused of using her legal team to shut down YouTube videos criticising her.

Jeremy 'TheQuareting' Hambly is a controversial YouTuber who says Imane 'Pokimane' Anys is "bullying" creators.

"Pokimane has had her legal team reach out to me...and demanded I take down some videos," he explains.

Pokimane's representatives have alleged that the videos don't fall under fair use, but have neglected to use YouTube's systems and processes to remove them.

TheQuartering points out that if they went through the proper channels on the platform, they'd have to "commit to going to court".

He goes on speculate that her team doesn't want to turn this into a legal battle, but has another agenda.

"They just want to bully creators. They want to scare you with legalese.

"Threaten lawsuits. And get you yo take down videos that are critical of Pokimane."

This isn't the first fair use / copyright scandal Pokimane has been involved with.

In 2019, she was called out by PewDiePie for trying to get a video taken down with a copyright strike.

At the time, he labelled her a hypocrite, citing examples of the Twitch star (and others) featuring other people's content in their videos.

Pokimane eventually apologised, admitting she didn't 'properly understand' fair use at the time.

"I thought Poki leaned about fair use 3 years ago?" TheQuartering tweeted, refencing that debacle.

"Essentially, anything that makes a creator look bad they’ll bully and bend the law, in my opinion, to get people to remove that content,” he said of Pokimane's representatives.

"They’re going around, and they’re going to get her in trouble legally," he stated, saying he's prepared to spend an "exorbitant amount of money" defending his videos.
