Today on The Ed Morrissey Show (4:00 pm ET!), we launch the next episode of the new #TEMS podcast. It’s now a fully downloadable and streamable show at Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Townhall Media’s YouTube channel, and on Rumble and our own in-house portal at the #TEMS page!

Join me as I discuss this episode’s interviews and take your questions:
• Andrew Malcolm joins us for Tuesdays with Andrew on our podcast! The Prince of Twitter and discuss all of the hot political stories of the day. I’ll go over the topics in the podcast, but you’ll have to download it to get all of Andrew’s incisive commentary. We also discuss his latest column on how Stephen Breyer threw Joe Biden a life-saver last week, and how that will play out.
• Get ready for some in-depth analysis from King Banaian of KYCR and St. Cloud State University’s School of Public Affairs. King served as an adviser to Ukraine’s central bank after the fall of the Soviet Union, and has a very nuanced take on the stakes involved now.
• Plus, you’ll hear my latest audio editorial for Townhall Commentary!

The Ed Morrissey Show and its dynamic chatroom can be seen on the permanent TEMS page. Be sure to join us, and don’t forget to keep up with the debate on my Facebook page, too!
