Sue Gray’s report into Covid lockdown rule-breaking in Downing Street has finally been published. Jessica Elgot analyses what it means for Boris Johnson’s future

Following weeks of allegations aired in the media and speculation over what she might uncover, senior civil servant Sue Gray delivered an outline of her report to the prime minister on Monday.

The Guardian’s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, tells Nosheen Iqbal that Sue Gray’s report contains minimal details of the parties the Met is investigating, which are among the most serious and most politically controversial breaches.

In a statement to the House of Commons, Johnson told MPs he accepted Gray’s limited findings and intended to shake up his Downing Street operation. In response, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, once again called on the prime minister to go, saying he is ‘unfit for office’.

Johnson’s future now rests with the mood of his MPs, many of whom have pushed for a full release of Gray’s detailed findings once the police investigation has concluded.
