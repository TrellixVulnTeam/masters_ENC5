GUILFORD COUNTY, N.C. (WGHP) — The North Carolina Commission on Public Health on Wednesday will consider a petition to make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for students who are at least 17 years old or entering their senior years of high school.

But three of the state’s top health officials, Dr. Elizabeth C. Tilson, the state’s health director, Dr. Kelly Kimple of the NC Department of Health & Human Service’s Women’s and Children’s Health Section and Mark T. Benton, assistant secretary for public health at NC DHSS, said they think such a change in rules would be “premature.”
