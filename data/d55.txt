AN original EastEnders cast member has passed away at the age of 95 today - but his cause of death is still unknown.

Albert Square veteran Leonard Fenton, who famously played original cast member Dr Harold Legg, passed away on Saturday, according to his family.

A statement from his relatives said: "The family of the actor Leonard Fenton are heartbroken to announce his death at the age of 95 on Saturday January 29. Best known for his role as Dr Legg on EastEnders, Leonard's acting career spanned more than 60 years.

"He worked in TV and film and his long stage career included time at the National Theatre and most recently the Royal Shakespeare Company. He felt privileged to have worked with some of the greats of the theatre, including Samuel Beckett, Orson Welles and Jonathan Miller.

"His passion for painting and singing pre-dated his acting career and was equally as important to him. He will be missed beyond words by his family. We feel incredibly lucky to have been able to be with him as his health worsened towards the end - a privilege denied to so many during these tough times."

He appeared in EastEnders in its very first episode, which aired on February 19, 1985, with his last scenes airing in 2019.
