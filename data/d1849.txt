Look back in history and every decade has had a distinctive haircut to represent the mood of the time, from Vidal Sassoon’s five-point cut in the Swinging Sixties to Farrah Fawcett’s feathered hairdo in the ’70s, to Jennifer Aniston’s layered shag in the ’90s.

Hair has always had the power to make over one’s image in a way that even clothes cannot. Interestingly, despite a raft of new haircuts emerging each season, the cuts hairdressers get asked for most don't veer far from the basic shapes, those versatile styles that can be adapted to suit anyone at any age.

Celebrity hairdresser George Northwood tells us that if you're looking for a new life direction a fresh cut can be the answer to feeling empowered. He says, ‘there’s a freedom in lopping off grown-out lengths into a sharp, proper haircut that puts us back in control.’
