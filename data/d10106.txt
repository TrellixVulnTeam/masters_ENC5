Feb. 2 (UPI) -- A Michigan man who won a $430,194 lottery jackpot said he had thought he didn't win anything from the drawing because he had forgotten buying extra tickets online.

The 56-year-old Ingham County man told Michigan Lottery officials he regularly plays the Fantasy 5 drawing using tickets bought both at stores and online.
