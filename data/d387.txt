Mike Pence reportedly refused to support a last-ditch effort to overturn the US election result in favour of Donald Trump. The vice-president apparently declined to join an effort by Republicans led by Louie Gohmert of Texas to hand him sole authority over electors when Congress meets on 6 January.

Meanwhile Mr Trump’s decision to pardon four Blackwater contractors convicted of killing unarmed Iraqi citizens in 2007 has been described by the UN as an affront to justice. An official said it would undermine the rule of international law.

Overnight, Georgia announced the results of its audit of voter signatures. Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, said it had found no evidence of fraud in Cobb County, adding: “This audit disproves the only credible allegations the Trump campaign had against the strength of Georgia’s signature match processes.”
