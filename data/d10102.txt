Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Thousands of people gathered in New York City on Wednesday to mourn the death of New York Police Department Officer Wilbert Mora, who was fatally shot on duty last month.

Mora was killed alongside his partner, Officer Jason Rivera, after responding to a domestic violence call. Rivera's memorial service was held last week, making Wednesday's event the second such funeral to take over an entire swath of the city.
