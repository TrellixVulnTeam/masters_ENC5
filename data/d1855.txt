The Judge presiding over the civil suit brought against the Duke of York has requested that the Prince’s former assistant, Robert Olney, give evidence.

Prince Andrew is being sued by Virginia Giuffre, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with the Duke when she was 17 years old.

The Duke of York denies all the allegations against him.

Judge Lewis A Kaplan has written to the Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division in an effort to get Mr Olney to testify regarding communication between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epsiten, Ghislaine Maxwell and Ms Giuffre as well as his travel to Epstein’s various properties.
