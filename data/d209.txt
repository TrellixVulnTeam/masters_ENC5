There’s nothing more discouraging than being told “you aren’t going to make it” in your life, career, or in some cases, a red carpet appearance. It’s hard to imagine that our famous celebrities have been put, at some point in their lives, under so much pressure to fit the industry’s unrealistic standards. Lately, they have been vocal about it, and these names might make your jaw drop.
