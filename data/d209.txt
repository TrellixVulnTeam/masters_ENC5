Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announces he will object to Electoral College certification.

“I Cannot Vote to Certify the Electoral College Results on January 6th,” says Hawley, who has been critical about the 2020 election since the results were first announced.

Hawley said in a statement earlier today (Wednesday) that he cannot vote to certify the Electoral College results January 6.

He pointed out that making such objections is nothing new. “Following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity,” said Hawley. “They were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.”

The effort in the House is being led by Rep. Mo Brooks, who told Fox News this week at least a dozen others will join him.

On the floor earlier this month Brooks said this:

With Hawley joining the small group of House Republicans in objecting, the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 would be dissolved and the House and Senate would then meet separately for two hours to debate a contested state’s electoral vote.

Brooks says Republicans are preparing to object to Joe Biden in as many as six states.

So with two hours of debate per state, the American people could be looking at a dozen hours of debate before a vote.
