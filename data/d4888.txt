FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) — A Fort Wayne man accused of fatally shooting two young men and wounding a third at a gas station has been found fit to stand trial.

After reviewing reports from three doctors, a judge found 33-year-old Joseph Bossard has "the ability to understand the proceedings and assist in the preparation of his defense,” a filing this week in Allen Superior Court said. Bossard had a competency hearing Jan. 10, WANE-TV reported.

Joshua Cooper and Anderson Retic, both 19, were shot while sitting in their car at a gas station on Feb. 17, 2021. A third person, Jaylin Rice, 20, was hospitalized is in serious condition.

A probable cause affidavit said Bossard engaged in “some kind of verbal confrontation with three young male black subjects” while they all were at a convenience store.
