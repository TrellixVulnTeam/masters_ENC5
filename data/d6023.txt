This made me emotional. Not cocky or fist pump-y just super emotional. Its been a hard road and governments around the world actually made it harder. To say Iâ€™m disappointed in them would be an understatement. But the people eventually came out and they came out strong and they stayed strong till the work was done to win back the freedoms. God bless everyone who is using what little voice they have to stop the madness of mandates that destroy people and take freedoms.
