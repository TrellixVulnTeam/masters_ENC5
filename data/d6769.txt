Democrats and the liberal media have declared Joe Rogan the new number one public enemy.

They claim he is spreading misinformation about COVID, but the truth is that they despise him for his massive influence and for not seeing the world exactly the way they do.

In a new development that is sure to drive the entire left insane, a poll has found that Joe Rogan enjoys a greater approval rating that Joe Biden.

You couldn’t make this up.

According to an Echelon Insights poll released on Monday, podcaster and TV Host Joe Rogan has a greater net approval rating among voters than President Biden. The poll found that Rogan’s net approval sits at plus two while Biden’s net approval sits at negative two. Among Democrats or those who lean left, Rogan’s net approval is at negative 14 points, while for those who are Republicans or lean right, Rogan holds a plus 17 net approval. The controversial podcaster’s net approval rating is also greater than Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat Party, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Breitbart reported. Rogan came under increased scrutiny last week after musician Neil Young pulled his music from Spotify in protest for the company’s contract with Rogan and refusal to take down videos from the podcaster that alleged contained COVID-19 misinformation, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

This is just hilarious.

Maybe Joe Rogan could give Joe Biden some pointers.
