Joe Rogan recently posted a 9 minute video where he broke his silence and spoke out on the Spotify “drama” from recent days.

Of course the whole thing is nonsense, but a whole bunch of has-beens and never-weres like Neil Young and the “Surgeon General” (ooooh, I’m so impressed) have attacked Rogan recently.

Because he dares to ask questions and think for himself!

It’s truly incredible when simply interviewing people (who are certified experts in their field) and asking them questions has become controversial….but it has.

So Rogan did what he does best…

He ripped open a mic and spoke directly to the people using common sense and plain English.

He talked like you or I would.

And that’s why millions love him.

I’ve got the full message for you here, and I thought it was excellent — although I do feel he is being pressured to cave or apologize or retract what he’s done, and I’m here to say STAND STRONG JOE!

Keep being you.

And you’ll be just fine.

You have all the power right now, because America stands behind you.
