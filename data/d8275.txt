The American model, 26, gushed over her daughter, who was born in September 2020, as she shared a rare insight into their lives together.

Proud mum Hadid praised her little girl for already being “so smart” and “so aware”.

She told InStyle magazine for their March edition: “She’s just so smart, and she’s so aware. She watches everything, she’s always learning, she’s always looking. She’s just awesome.”

Admittedly the catwalk star said it was “wild” she is a mum at 26 years old and now she has surrounded herself with “mum” friends.

She told the publication: “I still can’t believe it. It’s wild. A lot of my mom friends feel like that, and we’re nearing the first couple years [with our kids]. You’re obsessed with them, but sometimes you turn and you’re like, “Oh my god. Where did you come from?”

The glamorous star has been juggling her modelling career with being a doting mum to her little girl who is approaching two years old.

Last year, she split from the former One Direction star who is the father of her daughter in October.

They were a hot celebrity couple, having an on/off romance since 2015 in the full front of the spotlight.

She did not speak about her former flame in the new interview.

However, the starlet looked back on the life lessons she has learned in 2021 - including trying to find the beauty in everything - even when something is hard.

She added: “I’ve been reminded that when we get time with people, just really appreciate it and take it all in and try not to wish away moments. Even if there’s something hard, find something beautiful in it.”
