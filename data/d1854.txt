The average price for a home grew by nearly 1pc to £255,556 in January, in the best start to the year since 2005. Over the past 12 months house prices have now increased by 11.2pc, growing by nearly £500 per week, according to the lender Nationwide.

The total number of property transactions was the highest since 2007 and around 25pc higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019, as buyers continued to take advantage of cheap mortgage deals.

But Robert Gardner, of Nationwide, warned this growth could slow as affordability stretched to new extremes. “House price growth has outstripped earnings growth by a wide margin since the pandemic struck,” he said. “For example, a 10pc deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now equivalent to 56pc of total gross annual earnings, a record high.

“Similarly, a typical mortgage payment as a share of take-home pay is now above the long run average, despite mortgage rates remaining close to all-time lows.”
