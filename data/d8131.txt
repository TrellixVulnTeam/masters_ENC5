Several Southern suburbs have seen more than 8 inches of snowfall, according to data from the National Weather Service office in Romeoville.

Naperville is reporting more than 8 inches have fallen there by 3:30 p.m., while the gauges in parts of Will County are showing more than 10 inches so far, meteorologists said.

The weather services's official climate station at O'Hare International Airport recorded 5 inches of snowfall as of noon, with another reading coming at least 6 p.m. or later

The Northern suburbs have been largely spared from the snow as less than an inch was reported in Marengo.

A winter storm warning was in effect until 6 p.m. for many South suburbs. Forecasts call for as much as 5 more inches of snow in some parts through Thursday morning during a second round of storms that will blow through the area.

Lake effect snowfall in Cook and Lake Counties could bring between 2 and 5 inches as that storm rolls through, meteorologists said.

Multiple crashes were reported throughout the area, according to traffic monitoring website sigalert.com.

Indian Creek Road in Hawthorn Woods was closed for several hours between Gilmer and North Diamond Lake roads because of a crash, but it has since reopened.

More than 700 flights have been canceled at O'Hare over the past 24 hours, while nearly 100 flights have been canceled at Midway Airport, according to the Chicago Aviation Department's flight tracker website.
