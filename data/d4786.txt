On Monday, former democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard came out in support of podcast host Joe Rogan as Democrats continue to slander and try to cancel him.

Gabbard unleashed on “zealots of wokeism” for trying to silence opposing voices like Rogan.

“I get the feeling some people are using @joerogan‘s COVID interview as a pretext to silence his voice because he’s not woke. Zealots of wokeism try to censor voices who don’t agree with theirs, because they fear the absurdity and weakness of their positions will be exposed,” Gabbard posted on Twitter.

Gabbard wasn’t the only former Democratic presidential candidate this week to stand up for Rogan. Marianne Williamson also came to his defense as she mentioned his freedom of speech.

“I’m triple vaxxed, but (unless they’re standing for hate or calling for violence) banning someone’s podcast is too much like burning a book to me. Joe Rogan should talk on his podcast about whatever he damn well pleases,” Williamson said on Twitter.

Earlier this week, Rogan confronted his critics in an Instagram video where he defended his right to free speech.

“I’m just a person who sits down and talks to people and has conversations with them. Do I get things wrong? Absolutely. I get things wrong, but I try to correct them. Whenever I get something wrong. I try to correct it because I’m interested in telling the truth. I’m interested in finding out what the truth is. And I’m interested in having interesting conversations with people that have differing opinions. I’m not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective,” Rogan said in the video.

“Great stuff here brother. Perfectly articulated,” Johnson commented. “Look forward to coming on one day and breaking out the tequila with you.”
