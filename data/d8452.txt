China has now ordered the arrest of AstraZeneca officials over charges of fraud. The organization has taken disciplinary measures against those employees and has reported their offenses to the authorities.

The National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) announced on Saturday that Chinese authorities summoned officials from AstraZeneca China in connection with an investigation into potential medical insurance fraud by the company’s employees.

Authorities have ordered the arrest of all suspects, according to the state medical insurance fund’s regulator, but he did not specify the alleged violations or the amount of money involved, reports World is One News.

The NHSA also asked that AstraZeneca China rectify vulnerabilities in marketing activity supervision.

The company claimed in a statement on Friday that several personnel in Shenzhen, China’s southernmost city, had tampered with or assisted in the tampering of patients’ testing data and were accused of medical insurance fraud.

The NHSA and the Ministry of Public Security met with the officials of the organisation in December to notify them of the probe, according to the report.

“AstraZeneca China takes such employee misconduct seriously and welcomes the recommendations by the NHSA and MOPS,” it said.

All personnel implicated in the Shenzhen case, according to an AstraZeneca representative, are Chinese nationals.

According to the statement, the organization has taken disciplinary measures against those employees and has reported their offenses to the authorities.

The NHSA said that authorities will undertake countrywide campaigns to combat fraud involving the alteration of genetic test results, urging those involved to come forward.
