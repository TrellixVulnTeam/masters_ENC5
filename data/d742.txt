A PLAN has been lodged to convert Kidderminster offices at a Grade II listed building into new residential flats.

The historic Medical Hall, situated on the corner of Bull Ring and Church Street, could be transformed into four new homes if planning approval is granted.

Offices where the flats will be developed are currently vacant on the first and second floor of the building. The plan is to have two flats on each floor. The former Victorian Chemist was listed Grade II by Historic England back in 1980. The ground floor recently housed a Lloyds Pharmacy.
