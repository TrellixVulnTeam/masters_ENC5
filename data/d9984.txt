A senior Russian official at the United Nations has slammed British diplomacy, just hours before Boris Johnson speaks to Vladimir Putin to try to defuse the Ukraine crisis.

"There is always room for diplomacy, but frankly, we don't trust British diplomacy," Dmitry Polyanskiy, deputy ambassador to the UN told Sky News in an interview.

"I think in recent years British diplomacy has shown that it is absolutely worthless," he added.

"I really don't want to offend anybody, especially my good friends, British diplomats, but really, the results are nothing to boast about."

The Prime Minister visited Kyiv yesterday, warning that Russian forces massed on the border represented a "clear and present danger" to Ukraine.

Mr Johnson is scheduled to talk to Mr Putin in a delayed phone call to cool fears about the Kremlin's intent.

But Mr Polyanskiy's comments, although unsurprising given both countries have been at loggerheads for years, indicated that a breakthrough looked unpromising.

Mr Polyanskiy also said the West was exaggerating the number of Russian forces at the Ukraine border.

"Now it's already 130,000," he told Sky News. "I see that inflation is very high these days, it was 100,000 yesterday."

"I don't know where they take these figures from and we have absolutely no trust in the intelligence data from the US and from the UK."

"I think this is the same intelligence that claims that Saddam Hussein possesses the weapons of mass destruction," he added.

"The hysteria doesn't stop, it's absolutely happening in the heads of Western politicians and not really on the ground."
