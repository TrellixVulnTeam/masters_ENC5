"Devastated" residents have described seeing a fire rip through an 11th century church in Norfolk, destroying the thatched roof of the Grade I listed building.

Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said that six fire engines attended the blaze, which was now "under control".

"We will have a presence on scene for the rest of the day at least," a spokesman said.
