Acclaimed actors Jessica Chastain and Rita Moreno had a great time interviewing each other for Variety, but their first meeting was when they really became bosom buddies.

At least that’s how Moreno remembers it.

In a conversation that Variety posted Tuesday, the “West Side Story” star reminded Chastain that they’d first met at a restaurant and expressed admiration for each other.

“I was with a friend, and we were at the bar waiting for a table,” Moreno said. “You were leaving, and I said, ‘Oh, I love you.’ And I think you said, ‘I love you too.’ And I remember saying, ‘Really?’”

“As you were leaving, I said, ‘I love your breasts.’ Do you remember that?” Moreno asked.

Chastain searched her memory, but it was a bust.

“I must have thought you said, like, ‘I love your dress,’” Chastain said.

Moreno seemed to accept the explanation, but added: “I remember my friend, who’s gay, a close friend ― and he said to me, ‘I can’t believe you said that.’ And I said, ‘Why not?’”
