Kristiina, 30, is a certified “cuddle therapist” and offers to embrace those feeling lonely and isolated.

Her unusual service involves hand holding, hair stroking and hugging clients for up to three hours at a time, including in her double bed.

Kristiina, who says there are many emotional benefits to the practice, earns up to £170 per session and more than £1,500 a month.

She took a training course after a break-up three years ago.

Kristiina explained: “I was missing the cuddling and affectionate side of a relationship.

“I thought there should be a service where people help each other and cuddle.

Hugs release the love hormone oxytocin, which is known to help with loneliness, anxiety and depression

“In my work, I see a lot of people who are feeling isolated because of the pandemic as well as those who are grieving and in need of physical comfort.

"We cuddle in multiple ­positions such as standing up and spooning. Boundaries are always discussed before we begin.”

Kristiina, of Stratford, East London, stressed that her visiting clients — who are mostly men and mainly aged 30 to 40 — understand that “cuddling is a form of platonic touch therapy”.

Meanwhile, she is receiving plenty of hugs herself from her new love, partner Matt, 44.
