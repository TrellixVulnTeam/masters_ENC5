JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Senior Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Tomie T. Green announced Wednesday that she will retire at the end of this year.

Green, 69, has spent 24 years on the bench. She will not seek re-election and plans to retire on Dec. 31, WLBT-TV reported.

“I have served this district in all three branches of our government," Green said in a statement. “In the executive branch, I served as an assistant district attorney in Hinds and Yazoo counties. In the legislative branch, I served two terms in the Mississippi House of Representatives. And, lastly, I’ve served as a compassed member of the Mississippi Judiciary.”

In 2011, Green became the first African American and first woman to have the leadership role of senior circuit judge in the Seventh Circuit Court District. Green took office on Jan. 4, 1999. She was unopposed for re-election for five terms.
