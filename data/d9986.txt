Plaid Cymru has demanded an end to “quirky” non-traditional names after a farm named “Hakuna Matata” replaced the original Welsh title on an Ordnance Survey map.

Sara Davies bought a plot of empty land, originally named Banc Cornicyll, near Gorslas, Carmarthenshire, in 1997.

She built a house on the land and named the property with the Swahili phrase, which means “there are no troubles” and is used in the Disney film The Lion King.

Now it has emerged that this change means the original name no longer appears anywhere on the Ordnance Survey map.

Speaking to Wales Online, Mrs Davies said that the name, Banc Cornicyll, had disappeared before they had purchased the land in 1997, although it is listed on documents recording the sale still on the land registry.

She added: "We went to the Post Office, and said we were a new-build house.

"They said there was no registered address for the land so we could choose to call it whatever we liked.

"Obviously Lion King was popular at the time, some of my husband’s friends had been working in South Africa and knew that ‘hakuna matata’ wasn’t just a Disney term but genuine Swahili and therefore it had a meaning to it.”
