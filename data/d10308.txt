A 28-year-old UK woman is asking for help after being severely injured by her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 injection.

Footage from entrepreneur and painter Katrina Hermez’s Instagram shows her in a hospital bed suffering a seizure, one of her many side effects following the mRNA gene therapy.
• 10 episodes of temporary paralysis that lasts hours to days on end.

Hermez describes herself previously as a “really healthy 28-year-old girl” and regrets taking the injection that caused her adverse reaction.

She received the first injection on June 27, 2021 and suffered severe side effects five days later.

“In June 27th 2021 I made the decision like millions of other people to have the Pf👁zer 💉 because I believed, (as don’t forget…we were told) this would protect us and the people around us. Now a proven lie,” she wrote in a caption accompanying her post, using emojis to bypass censors. Hermez, who says she used to “run nearly everyday” before needing a wheelchair and assistance to walk, says she’s being neglected by medical professionals who fear attributing her illness to the jab. “I’ve come to a point in this suffering where I don’t care what medical science you have read on Google, which book you’re going by, which doctor’s surgery has set this agenda, or which news channel you’ve watched… I am being neglected by medical professionals scared to lose their jobs,” she says adding, “I am v 💉 injured.”

On her GoFundMe, that has currently raised over £6,500, Katrina states:

It all started in July, I started to feel off, I got brain fog, vertigo, I got skin rashes and I started to feel sick. I suddenly started having episodes of memory loss and my first episode was when I was going for a walk and then 30min later, wondering why I was walking and where I was. Then it became more severe. A few days later, I went shopping and was paying at the till and I was talking to someone, and then ten minutes later, I couldn’t remember who I was talking to and where I was. It was in that moment when I realised my health was deteriorating and that scared me. Then a month passed and my tolerance to certain foods extremely weakened. My mental health crashed, I got extremely hypersensitive and irritated over the smallest things, making it difficult for my family and friends. As time passed I was completely blindsided and hit with my first seizure. Then a month later in November, I was found on the floor at work completely paralysed and unable to speak. Paramedics came and thought I had a Stroke or MS, I stayed in the hospital for a week and the doctors conducted CAT and MRI scans until they gave me a quick diagnosis of Functional neurological disorder without any further assessments. Yet my life has completely been turned upside down and now I cannot leave the house without someone’s help and my walking stick. I seem to be getting a multitude of new symptoms as the days go by. Blood in my ear, my ears aching everyday and the ringing and dizziness doesn’t go away. I struggle to write emails or read because most of the time I’m completely dissociated from life and I get frequent migraines after reading. I’ve had four episodes of severe temporary full body paralysis and slurred speech that takes a while to recover from. I’ve also had four less severe episodes that involve having my friends find me on the floor or unable to move and respond normally and having to pick me up. That would be a total of eight episodes since November. I went from being a really healthy 28 year old girl who didn’t get sick for three years (not even a cold) that runs nearly everyday to needing a walking stick/ sometimes a wheelchair and being assigned carers as well as not being able to work at all because of my illness. I’m frightened that as time passes, the symptoms will get worse. The scary thing is, it can happen anytime even whilst I feel good with no stress in me. On “normal” days I get severe brain fog, my mind can’t process much. Conversations in itself is exhausting and I can only handle a small amount of it each day. I just want my life or at least little of it back. My goal with this is to get treatment from a regenerative medical clinic in America that specialises with my illness, due to the unfortunate fact that the few hospitals I’ve stayed at have been unable to provide me any method of treatment. I appreciate every donation and I would really appreciate it if you would kindly set yourself to not be “anonymous” so I can personally reach out to offer my thanks.

She provided this update on January 27, 2022:

I’m hoping to get medical treatment from Dr Mark Ghalili as he specialises with my type of illness from the f-eye-zer / va – injection injury. His medical clinic is called regenerative medicine LA, however as my symptoms worsen each day and the pain is taking over, I don’t know how I will be able to do with a 14 hour flight journey.

 Private health insurance don’t cover past or existing health issues. So to go private here in the UK will cost roughly around the same as Dr Ghalili’s treatments.

 I have already been seen by a handful of doctors here and neurologists and I have been told that they’ll take my case “slowly but surely” it has already been 6 months and I haven’t gotten anywhere.
