Hormone replacement therapy is to be made available over the counter for the first time, watchdogs are poised to announce.

Until now, women have only been able to access the medication after consultation with a GP or specialist.

Every year, around 1.5 million women experience troubling post-menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbance and emotional problems. Of those, around 150,000 are prescribed HRT in the form of tablets, gels, creams or patches.

The Telegraph can disclose that watchdogs are set to propose a reclassification of the medication so women are able to access it in a pharmacy without a prescription.

It follows changes last summer that saw the contraceptive pill sold over the counter following a relaxation of rules by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

It also comes after a long campaign to improve access to HRT and reduce the cost for women who receive it on prescription.

In October, ministers announced that costs would be cut by up to £200 a year after the Government backed a campaign championed by celebrities including Penny Lancaster and Davina McCall. Under that change, costs of up to £19 per month can be replaced by one annual prescription for the same cost.

The latest proposal aims to improve convenience so that women are able to access HRT more easily, without needing a GP appointment. But it follows years of debate over the risks and benefits of HRT, which has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.

Haitham Hamoda, the chairman of the British Menopause Society, said: "Improving access to HRT is a good thing, but it is really important that women can access all the help and advice they need.

"It's great that there is so much conversation about menopause now, and people are far more open about it. But we don't want this to come down to a question of self-diagnosis – it's really important that those thinking about starting HRT get the right information."
