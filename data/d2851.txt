The Londoner, who played Nomi in No Time to Die, is one of five actors shortlisted for the prize. She is joined by fellow Londoner Harris Dickinson, West Side Story star Ariana DeBose, A Quiet Place actress Millicent Simmonds and The Power of the Dog’s Kodi Smit-McPhee.

Lynch said: “The EE Rising Star Award is one I’ve always admired for recognising exciting emerging talent. I’m so elated for my fellow nominees who inspire myself and others, as we continue to fight for change within our industry and the world. I’m proud to be able to do that in moments like these.”

The shortlist was picked by a panel including Andy Serkis, Sadie Frost and Michelle Dockery. Actress and filmmaker Bukky Bakray, who won the award last year, said: “The EE Rising Star award is such a gratifying face of recognition and I know first-hand the true gift that it is to be recognised for this accolade.”

The Rising Star award is the only Bafta voted for by the public, with the winner announced at the ceremony on March 13. Voting is now open at ee.co.uk/bafta
