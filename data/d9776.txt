A team of doctors and nurses made their way around the escalation ward of the intensive care unit, set aside for treating coronavirus patients. They hover over charts and compare notes on the five patients. Each needs near constant care.

Four of them are hooked up to ventilators, and the rhythmic beeping of the machines hums steadily in the background.

This area was set up at the height of the pandemic to treat the most critically ill Covid patients. The space was originally a reception area for surgery and was never intended to be used for this specialized care. But since the spring of 2020, it has never closed.

Dr. Susan Jain, a specialist in anesthesia and intensive therapy, and a lead doctor, said it was like trying to set up a specialist unit in a living room. The area wasn’t fit for the purpose.

Things have slowed, she said, but the staff are still on emergency footing.

“We haven’t seen a point yet where we’re convinced that the number of Covid cases that are seriously ill are petering out,” she said. “So there’s a sort of unpredictability hanging in the air, about how much and for how long the pressures continue, but it is there for the foreseeable future.”

Mary Connolly, a senior nurse who has worked here for 32 years, moved with ease from bed to bed, rattling off vital details of the care of each patient. Nearly all they are now treating are unvaccinated, she explained. A handful deny that the virus even exists.

“It’s the new thing now, people are refusing to be tested at all,” she says, shaking her head. A man with a tracheotomy moans as she and another nurse slide him up the bed to prepare him for an X-ray.
