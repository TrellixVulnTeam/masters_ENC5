CLASSY model Lara Worthington stripes down to a strapless bikini to soak up the sun Down Under.

The poised mum of three, 34, was promoting a swimsuit range on a beach in her homeland.

She is wed to fellow Aussie Sam Worthington, 45, star of sci-fi hit Avatar and, just like the film, she looked out of this world.

It comes as last year, the couple sold their £6million Hollywood home and moved to her native Sydney earlier this year.

Mum-of-three Lara said: “Spending time with my family at the beach is something I cherish.”

Lara spent lockdown devising home-workouts with her kids and her hubby.
