Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The U.S. National Archives said In a letter dated Tuesday that it will release more documents to the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

The letter, from Archivist David Ferriero to former President Donald Trump, says it will hand over vice presidential records to the committee that Trump had previously asserted Jan. 18 were privileged.
