A comedian named Steve Byrne said he was invited on a news show last night to discuss Joe Rogan, but he was disinvited when he wouldn’t bash him:

“Here’s everything you need to know about how media has a @joerogan narrative. I was asked, as a comic, to join a news program to discuss. I accepted. They said they wanted to bash him. I said I believe he provides another perspective & that’s good for debate. I was disinvited.”

He tweeted this last night just before the 8pm hour, which tells me it was probably the 8pm hour on CNN or MSNBC.

I wish Byrne would have named the news show, but does it really matter? Whether it’s CNN or MSNBC, we’ve known for a long time that the garbage media doesn’t care about truth or being objective. They only care about their narrative and in this case it’s all about destroying Rogan.
