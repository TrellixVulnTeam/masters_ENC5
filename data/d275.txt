In today’s Situation Update for Dec. 30th, we analyze a more comprehensive theory of the Nashville bombing which reveals a desperate ploy by the CIA and FBI to destroy key evidence of election fraud.

Importantly, this bombing is proof that the fight is still on, and the deep state is terrified that Trump is about to expose their election crimes. (Which he will, it seems.)

Note also that today, Sen. Josh Hawley (from Missouri) has publicly stated he will challenge the electoral votes from fraudulent swing states on January 6th, invoking the joint session debate over which slate of electors should be recognized. This means there remains the possibility, however small, of a legal / civil outcome for Trump to achieve victory on January 6th, which would avoid Trump needing to invoke more aggressive military authority measures to defend the republic against widespread election fraud and treasonous actors.

Note that tomorrow’s podcast will be very short, due to staff limitations on New Year’s Day.

Here are the highlights from today’s podcast, which is especially hilarious at certain moments:
• “Missile theory” for Nashville gains credibility with new analysis and sources via Jeffrey Prather.
• Lack of a street crater is now explained by the bomb being a penetrator munition, dropped from altitude and guided to the final target via IR painting. In its final moments, it may have fired its own propellant to accelerate velocity for maximum penetration. This explains the “missile trail” in the skyline video.
• The NY Times is now warning Pence to not invoke his authority on January 6th, thereby confirming that this tactic would be effective and should be invoked by Pence.
• Biden confirms the Trump administration is keeping Biden in the dark on national defense, further demonstrating that Trump has no plans for any transition of power to treasonous China puppet Joe Biden.
• Grocery stores and pharmacies across America are engaged in “prison camp training” with mask mandates, floor placards for social distancing, and coming mandatory vaccines. This is attempting to normalize Americans to the upcoming FEMA camps which will house, and then eliminate, tens of millions of new homeless whose livelihoods were deliberately destroyed by punitive lockdowns.
• Most people have joined an insane covid cult called the “Branch Covidians,” and obedience is mandatory.
• Masks no longer have any justifiable purpose since recent science proves that asymptomatic people don’t spread the coronavirus.
• A secret provision in the government funding bill has the US Senate demanding all government agencies reveal everything they know about UFOs within 180 days. Is the world preparing for disclosure? (I’m getting more hints of orbital weapons tech now in play, by the way…)
• Most likely explanation of the Nashville attack involves a 250 lb. SDB (Small Diameter Bomb) dropped from a CIA-controlled MQ9 Reaper, which was able to escape because the explosion also took out the ZME air space comms and controls of the FAA.
• The FBI rapidly appeared on the scene in order to bury the evidence of their crimes, confirms Prather. This has long been the role of the FBI: To cover up the crimes of the deep state and shape the ridiculous public narrative.
• US Army is now outfitting Stryker vehicles with high-energy laser weapons systems in the 50 kW range of power. That’s the public explanation. Secretly, the power is no doubt much higher.
• Trump campaign files with SCOTUS to overturn Wisconsin fraud. We don’t expect this to achieve victory, but it’s establishing the justification for Trump to invoke military solutions after exhausting every possible civil court / legal option.
• AZ GOP electors join the lawsuit against Pence, hoping to force the courts to conclude Pence has absolute authority to throw out electoral votes from fraudulent states.
• The GOP is history. Trump supporters prepare to abandon the GOP. Trump is the model for the future of any pro-America party. Mitch McConnell just committed political suicide, and he’s going to drag the entire GOP down with him. Good riddance! Ditch Mitch!
• Full reveal of the ownership structure behind Dominion.
• The use of modems on voting machines renders all such elections “uncertifiable” and invalid.
• More proof the covid-19 vaccine is spreading covid, just as we warned would be the case. People are getting sick from covid after getting the vaccine.
