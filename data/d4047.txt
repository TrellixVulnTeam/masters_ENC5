Students in Boston woke up to find the inside of their flat covered in snow because their housemate forgot to close the window while she went to stay at her boyfriend's.

As Storm Kenan currently rips through the US, most people chose to stay warm and dry at home.

But one group of students got a shock when they found snow piling up inside one of the bedrooms after two inches of the white stuff fell on the city overnight.

The student who left the window open had been snowed in at her boyfriend's.

She has been named only as Ashlyn, and had now idea her room was covered in snow as if it was outside.

Taking to TikTok, Ashlyn's flatmate, on the social media site as @youaintseennothingg, said: "The consequences of leaving your apartment window open during a Boston blizzard."

Alongside it they shared a video of the snow-covered bedroom.

It appears that @youaintseennothingg and a third flatmate, Bella, were at home when the snow was collecting in Ashlyn's bedroom.

The TikToker texted Bella: "I'm kinda frozen" and Bella agreed, suddenly realising a cold draft was coming from somewhere else in the flat.

She realised it was coming from Ashlyn's room and dropped her a text.

Ashlyn admitted to leaving her window open but said it was just a "crack" before asking if her roommates would use the spare key to go in and close the window.

But when the TikToker and Bella let themselves into the room all wrapped up, they were met with a shocking sight.

The window had been wide open overnight and a blanket of snow covered the room, about an inch or two.

The bed, desk, chair and even a pair of shoes were covered.

Not only did the two roommates close the window, but they began trying to sweep and clean up in Ashlyn's room.

The room mates were nice about Ashlyn's mistake, explaining she was from California so might not be used to such extreme weather.
