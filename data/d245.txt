Jon Ossoff (D) shut down Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s (R-GA) criticism of her opponent Rev. Raphael Warnock (D) telling Fox News that she had been “campaigning with a Klansman.”

Said Ossoff: “She is stooping to these vicious personal attacks to distract from the fact that she’s been campaigning with a former member of the Ku Klux Klan. I mean we deserve better than that here in Georgia.”
