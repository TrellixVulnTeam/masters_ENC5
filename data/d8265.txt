Temperatures are set to plunge across the country as the UK faces a “big change” in the weather for awhile, forecasters have warned.

Snow could cover the ground by Friday after the UK is set to battle a cold front on Thursday.

The Met Office tweeted on Wednesday: “It’s been a mild winter so far, however a big change is on the way later this week.

“We say goodbye to the mild conditions most places have today, as much colder Arctic air floods southwards across all areas. Some of us will even see some snow by Friday.”

On Tuesday, the Met Office tweeted: “An active cold front will sweep southeastwards across the country later on Thursday introducing a brief shot of colder Polar air to end the week.”

The prediction of cooler weather comes after the UK enjoyed its third sunniest January on record.

The warmest winter day in the UK was recorded three years ago.

It reached 21.2C at Kew Gardens on February 26 in 2019.

The warmer winter temperature beat the only other winter temperature above 20C recorded the day before.
