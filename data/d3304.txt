A wedding is reportedly ‘on the cards’ for Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, after they made their pregnancy reveal earlier this week.

The Barbados-born signer, 33, and her Harlem-born boyfriend, also 33, announced they are expecting their first child in a series of stunning baby bump pictures released to the public.

Now, according to a source close to the singer, the pair may have cause to have double celebrations in the future.

A source said: ‘A wedding “is on the cards” for Rihanna and A$AP.’

They added to The Sun: ‘It is something they have discussed, so it might not be long before they have another surprise.

‘Of course, Rihanna would like to get married. She would love this for her little family.

‘She is a woman of her own means though, still independent, so there’s no rush.’

In the gorgeous photoshoot, Rihanna was photographed in a bright pink $8,000 (£5,000) vintage Chanel coat, which she wore open in order to show off her pregnant belly.

She accessorised with a large bejewelled chain that hung across her stomach, ensuing all eyes were on her growing bump.

Rihanna and A$AP were initially linked in 2020, after it was revealed they were dating after the singer’s split from boyfriend of four years Hassan Jameel.

The couple had been acquainted since the early 2010s, when they began performing and touring with one another.

In early December, rumours started to fly that Rihanna was pregnant, after she wore an orange halter top to an event.

But she batted off the rumours. Responding to a fan on Instagram, she said: ‘Haaaaa! Stawwwp! You ain’t came to the first 10 baby showers!’
