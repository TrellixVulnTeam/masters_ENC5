Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) called on non-Republicans to create an “uneasy alliance” with anti-Trump Republicans who are facing off in primaries against candidates who have been endorsed by the former U.S. president, The Hill reports.

Said Kinzinger: “People need to wake up to that real possibility. We have to be able to have uneasy alliances, as uneasy as they may be in this moment.”
