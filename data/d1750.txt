THE BBC are getting ready to unleash their latest phycological thriller, Chloe.

The drama follows a social media-obsessed woman who goes undercover to solve a suspicious death.

When does Chloe start on BBC1?

There isn't long to wait for this new six-part series.

The show kicks off at 9pm on February 6, 2022 on BBC One.

You will also be able to watch episodes on the BBC iPlayer.

The series will also be available in the US on Amazon Prime.

What is Chloe about?

Becky, still living with her mum and working as a temp, compares herself to the picture-perfect lives on Instagram, compulsively returning to one account: Chloe’s. Becky obsessively watches her seemingly flawless life through social media.

But when Chloe dies suddenly, Becky’s need to find out how and why leads her to assume a new identity and engineer a ‘chance’ meeting with Chloe’s best friend, Livia, and infiltrate Chloe's group of close-knit friends.

Through her alter-ego Sasha, Becky becomes a powerful, transgressive heroine; a popular, well-connected ‘someone’ with a life, and loves, that are far more exciting and addictive than the ‘no-one’ she is as Becky.

However, the pretence soon obscures and conflates reality, and Becky risks losing herself completely in the game she is playing.
