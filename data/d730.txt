Senator Amy Klobuchar — “This is how you run for President on the Republican side in 2024. You join a coup attempt. Democracy will prevail. As lead Dem on Rules Committee, I will guarantee it. There’s a bipartisan group of electeds who will put our country first. See you on the 6th!”

It can hardly be called a ‘coup attempt’ when the Constitution is being followed to the letter.
