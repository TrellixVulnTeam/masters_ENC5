Wednesday is National Girls and Women in Sports Day, a moment to celebrate all those who work to provide equitable access to sports for all girls and women – emphasis on all. I’m using this day, two days before the start of the Winter Olympics, to think about what the game of soccer has meant to me and to advocate for all the women and girls, including and especially transgender girls, who just want a chance to play sports.
