“I’m talking about opening up a mass movement throughout the state of Oregon,” were the words of Stan Pulliam, the Republican mayor of Sandy, Oregon, who defies the strict orders of Democratic Gov. Kate Brown that force everyone to take refuge in their homes, keep their businesses closed, and promote total isolation with all that that implies.

Pulliam, in a show of total confrontation with the governor’s orders, during an interview with Fox News made an express request to small businesses in his county and the rest of the state to open their doors on New Year’s Day in defiance of the restrictions imposed by Kate Brown because of the CCP Virus.

The conflict began after Brown announced last week the extension of the state of emergency until March 3, 2021. Each county in Oregon will be tested and, depending on the number of declared positive CCP Virus cases, will be categorized into different levels of risk with various restrictions.

Pulliam criticized the governor’s policies in different media and said that he and the citizens of Oregon are tired of the double standard measures, “People can gather in the malls of the big chains, but for some reason we cannot sit and support the local business owners along our main street. The double standards have to end.”

Now Pulliam has asked businesses to ignore CCP Virus orders statewide and stay open. “What we are talking about is the mass movement opening up across Oregon in all of our local communities on January 1st, New Year’s Day,” said Pulliam.

He also warned that precautions should be taken such as the use of proper face masks, timely distance between people, and disinfecting environments.

Last week, Pulliam said he was upset because when he had contact with the governor, she claimed to have evidence that “gyms, restaurants, and bars contribute to the spread of the virus,” but she never kept her promise that her staff would send him the evidence.

In defense of the work of his citizens, Pulliam continued, “We are at the table ready to talk and negotiate, but let us open the doors and get these employees back to work,” Pulliam said at the time.

“I think all Oregonians should pause, stand up, and say ‘this must stop,'” Pulliam told America’s Newsroom on Wednesday.

With the widespread outrage over the ridiculous rules of Democratic politicians who seek, who knows when, to keep people locked up, out of the mainstream, out of work and out of school, more and more people like Pulliam are declaring themselves in “healthy defiance.”

Such is the case of Riverside County, California, Sheriff Chad Bianco, who posted a video a couple of weeks ago declaring that he will not enforce the latest lockdown measures from Gov. Gavin Newsom, which he said would devastate hospitals, businesses, schools, and civil liberties.

“These closures and requests to stay home are absolutely ridiculous. The metrics used for the closures are incredibly flawed and not representative of the actual numbers, and are disastrous for Riverside County,” Bianco said in the video.
