The FIFA 22 TOTW 20 may be one of the weakest so far in FUT 22, with only a couple of big named players potentially set to feature.

The FIFA 22 Team of the Week 20 (TOTW 20) is expected to be revealed and released into packs on Wednesday, February 2, 2022, at 18:00 PMT GMT, and due to the current international break which doesn't include any European countries, some of the top performers from AFCON and the South American World Cup Qualifiers could be included.

Liverpool's Sadio Mane grabbed an assist and Man of the Match in his national team's 3-1 win to send Senegal through to the AFCON semi-finals, and many reliable sources on social media have leaked that Mane will feature in TOTW 20.

Paris Saint-Germain's Angel Di Maria could be included in the TOTW after he scored and grabbed the Man of the Match award in Argentina's 2-1 win over Chile, whilst Atletico Madrid's Luis Suarez scored the only goal and was MOTM in Uruguay's 1-0 victory against Paraguay.

Here are Mirror Football's FIFA 22 TOTW 20 predictions and a round-up of all the social media leaks.

FIFA 22 Team of the Week 20 (TOTW 20) leaks and predictions

The FUT 22 TOTW 20 line-up will be picked on single performances only, so goals and assists are not added cumulatively within the TOTW period. Also, note that performances in domestic cup competitions do not count towards TOTW selection criteria. Only one player from any one team can be included in a TOTW line-up, barring exceptional circumstances.

Also note that players included in either of the last two TOTW line-ups are ineligible, as are players who have featured in a recent FUT 22 promo.

The only TOTW 20 player to be leaked so far is Mane, via reliable sources such as @trustyfuttrader and @FutSheriff.

Below is just a FUT 22 TOTW 20 prediction, so there is no guarantee that any players mentioned below will be included.
• GK: Guillermo Ochoa (CF America) - Clean sheet and three saves in 0-0 draw
• RB: James Tavernier (Rangers) - One goal and MOTM in 3-3 draw
• LB: Antonee Robinson (Fulham) - One goal, clean sheet and MOTM in 1-0 win
• RM: Karl Toko Ekambi (Lyon) - Two goals and MOTM in 2-0 win
• RM: Otavio (Porto) - Two assists and MOTM in 2-1 win
• RW: Angel Di Maria (PSG) - One goal and MOTM in 2-1 win
• ST: Luis Suarez (Atletico Madrid) - One goal and MOTM in 1-0 win
