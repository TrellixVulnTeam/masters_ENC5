rsenal are looking to kick off 2021 with a bang as the Gunners head to West Brom seeking a third straight Premier League win.

The 2020/21 season has been tough for Arsenal domestically, with an awful run of form raising the genuine prospect of a potential relegation battle.

But Mikel Arteta's side have rallied of late, beating Chelsea and Brighton to ease the pressure on the manager.

Next on Arsenal's list is a trip to face Sam Allardyce's West Brom, who followed up a fine 1-1 draw at Liverpool by crashing to a 5-0 home defeat to Leeds.

The match will be held behind closed doors at The Hawthorns due to coronavirus restrictions.

TV channel: The match will be shown on BT Sport 1 with coverage from 7:30pm.

Live stream: BT Sport subscribers can watch the match online via the BT Sport website or BT Sport app via smartphone, tablet and laptop.

Bukayo Saka is expected to be fit for Arsenal with Arteta set for a selection headache. The teenager was forced off late at Brighton where Alexandre Lacazette scored off the bench after he reported a sore back.

The pair should be fit to start while David Luiz and Willian (both illness) may be available, but Thomas Partey (thigh) remains absent along with Gabriel (coronavirus) and Reiss Nelson has a minor muscle injury.

Allardyce is expected to make changes. The manager questioned his players' commitment against Leeds and Filip Krovinovic, Matheus Pereira and Branislav Ivanovic could return.

Kieran Gibbs is a doubt with a quad injury after pulling out of the warm-up ahead of the Leeds defeat and Jake Livermore serves the final game of his three-match ban.

The Baggies' humbling by Leeds proved Allardyce's team can be gotten at, and Arsenal will feel another three points are there for the taking following back-to-back wins.
