British snowboarder Katie Ormerod has admitted her surprise at the state of the controversial fake snow which is being used exclusively at a Winter Olympics for the first time.

With two days to go before the opening of the Beijing Games, beleaguered organisers battling Covid cases and diplomatic boycotts over the country's human rights records were given a boost with Ormerod one of several athletes describing the artificial white stuff as "amazing".

"Itâ€™s much better than I thought it would be as artificial snow," she said.

The decision to award snow-shy Beijing the Winter Olympics - making it the first city to host both a summer and winter Games - means more than 100 snow generators and 300 snow-cannons will be employed flat out to cover the slopes, an operation requiring an estimated 49 million gallons of water for the duration of the sporting event.

Amid the obvious huge environmental impact, others have raised fears over athlete safety with fake snow tending to be more compact, which can make for inconsistent icy conditions when combined with differing temperatures, and subsequent issues around athlete take-off and landings.

Despite having been schooled mainly on indoor dry slopes growing up in Yorkshire, Ormerod had previously expressed concern for the state of the slopes prior to departing for Beijing, where she is due to compete in the slopestyle and Big Air competitions.

But after getting an initial taste with a first inspection of the "spectacular" slopestyle course at the Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou on Tuesday, she was feeling more optimistic.
