Feb. 1 (UPI) -- The Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams are hopeful that respective tight ends C.J. Uzomah and Tyler Higbee can play in Super Bowl LVI after they each sustained knee injuries in their conference championship games.

Uzomah was carted off the field in the first quarter of the Bengals' 27-24 AFC Championship victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in Kansas City, Mo. Higbee also sustained his injury in the first quarter of the Rams' win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in Inglewood, Calif.
