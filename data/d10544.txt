CNN President Jeff Zucker resigned Wednesday after revealing he failed to disclose what he called a “consensual relationship with my closest colleague” during a probe of Chris Cuomo at the network.

Zucker announced his resignation in an email sent to all staffers worldwide, and it is effective immediately.

“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong,” he wrote. “As a result, I am resigning today.”

He should have resigned for destroying a news network that at one time actually reported news.

Zucker didn’t say who the colleague was that he said he had a “consensual relationship” with, but this news comes just a few weeks after reports ran that he has been dating CNN’s Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Allison Gollust, for years.

He continued, “I came to CNN on January 28, 2013. Together, we had nine great years. I certainly wish my tenure here had ended differently. But it was an amazing run. And I loved every minute. I am grateful to the thousands of incredibly talented CNN and Turner Sports employees who helped make this such a joy for me, and such a success for all of us. I wish each of you nothing but the best in the years ahead.”

Four of those nine “great years” were spent almost exclusively on attacking former President Donald Trump. The undercover journalism outlet Project Veritas shows videos of CNN employees admitting that Zucker told them to trash Trump as much as possible.

The CNN coffee boy, Brian Stelter, tweeted out the news of Zucker’s resigning.

Yeah, keep looking at Fox, Brian, because the ones having trouble.
