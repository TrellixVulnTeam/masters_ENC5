A model dresses up to reveal this Autumn's latest trends.

The camouflaged outfit was paraded at Copenhagen's Fashion Week.

It was complete with horse-chestnut handbag.

Another model headed down the catwalk carrying what appeared to be several swimming noodles under her arm.

Both garments may sink without trace.
