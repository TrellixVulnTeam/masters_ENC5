Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said the wide availability of highly effective vaccines means the U.S. mentality needs to evolve, Politico reports.

Said McConnell: “It’s time for the state of emergency to wind down… What exactly are we doing here? Where are the goalposts? What’s the end game?”

He added:”Consider if this variant were its own separate virus that we were just meeting for the very first time without the scar tissue from the prior two years. Nobody would accept anywhere near this much disruption to fight the virus that we’re actually facing right now.”
