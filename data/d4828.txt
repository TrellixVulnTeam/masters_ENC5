Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Michael Avenatti will not testify at his trial against former client Story Daniels, he said Tuesday in Manhattan Federal Court.

Avenatti told Judge Jesse M. Furman that he had no witnesses in court who were ready to testify against the charges that he cheated Stormy Daniels out of nearly $300,000 in book proceeds.
