Urban Meyer thinks the Cincinnati Bengals have a great shot to win the Super Bowl.

During an interview with Outkick’s Dan Dakich, the former Jacksonville Jaguars head coach broke down his opinions of what will happen in the Super Bowl. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

Meyer admitted that the Rams are clearly the more talented team, but he hasn’t ruled out picking the Bengals! In fact, he said he’s “leaning towards” taking Joe Burrow and company.

I love how Urban Meyer spent that entire clip hyping up how incredible the Rams are as a team, and then at the last moment, he did a 180 by claiming he’s “leaning towards” riding with Burrow.

That was one hell of a massive twist that we didn’t see coming!

The unfortunate part for Meyer is that I’m not sure anyone is going to take his opinions too seriously these days.

He burned his credibility when he was run out of Jacksonville. His NFL career came crashing down in spectacular fashion.

Now, does that mean he doesn’t know anything about football just because he failed in the NFL? Of course not. That’d be a ridiculous thing to believe.

So, who are you riding with in the Super Bowl? It sounds like Meyer will ultimately take the Bengals. Let us know who you think will win in the comments!
