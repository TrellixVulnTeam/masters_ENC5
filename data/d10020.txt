The Government has said that by 2030 no purely petrol or diesel cars will be allowed to be sold brand new in the UK and that, by 2035, hybrids will even be banned too.

In other words, in 13 years' time, the UK’s new car sales market will be almost entirely electric. That means manufacturers have until then to get a range of electric models on sale and available to us to replace the vast array of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars currently on offer.

No small feat, frankly. And of course, an electric car won’t suit everyone; finding a solution that works for those whose annual mileage is too great, or who simply don’t have access to an electric car charger at home or nearby, will be imperative in the intervening years.

But if you can make the switch, electric cars offer plenty of benefits, even now. Not only are modern electric cars fast and quiet, but they’re also cheap to run and maintain and mechanically very simple.

Besides, switching to electric before we’re forced to could help you to get your head around the ins and outs of charging, as well as to work out whether range anxiety really will affect you. Fancy it? If so, we reckon these are the best EVs on sale today.
