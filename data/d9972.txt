A "CREEPY" man has been caught on CCTV hanging around a woman's front door in the middle of the night.

The worried resident has warned her neighbours to be vigilant after she saw a man waiting outside her home at 3:15am on Monday.

She reported the odd incident in Hartlepool, Co Durham, to cops, but claims officers didn't ask for the footage.

The horrified homeowner told TeesideLive: "He was stood there for a few minutes from 3.15am to 3.21am.

"Then he disappeared for an hour, I'm not sure to where.

"Then he came back running from the side of our house and into a car.

"Nothing seems to be taken but it's just super creepy."

The unknown individual was seen outside the property in The Darlings, in Hart Village.

The woman shared the film on a community Facebook page to raise awareness of the creep.

Cleveland Police declined to comment on the incident.

The woman added: "I’ve asked my neighbours but as far as I can tell it's just around our house.

"The villages need a police presence – it will reduce fear 100 per cent."

Another local resident reported a similar event that allegedly took place several weeks ago.

She said: "A few weeks back I came out of our house early one morning when it was still dark, at about 5.45am."

"I noticed a male figure stood over the road, just standing there staring. He then disappeared.

"I didn't recognise this person; he wasn't a dog walker or anyone I would have known from the village and it really unnerved me."
