NASA has revealed plans to bring the International Space Station out of orbit.

The space agency is planning to crash the spacecraft back down on Earth by 2031 into a so-called 'space graveyard'.

Point Nemo, Latin for "no one", is around 4,000 metres deep and further from land than any point on Earth, making it the ideal spot to crash defunct rockets and satellites.

Hundreds of spacecraft – mostly Russian – have been laid to rest there by Nasa and other space agencies since it was first used in 1971.

US President Biden has committed to keeping the space lab operational until 2030.

"While the ISS will not last forever, NASA expects to be able to operate it safely through 2030," a NASA report said.
