A large fire has ripped through a car garage close to an Underground station in London.

Two Tube lines are disrupted as 70 firefighters and ten fire engines race to the scene on Bollo Lane, Acton.

Pictures show flames and black smoke billowing into the air from the single-storey car garage, which is next to Acton Town Tube station.

There is no service on the Piccadilly line between Hammersmith, Heathrow Airport and Uxbridge, and no service on the District line between Turnham Green and Ealing Broadway.

There are a number of gas cylinders inside the garage, which firefighters are cooling to an ambient temperature as some cylinders can explode when exposed to heat.

The cause of the fire is not yet known, according to the London Fire Brigade (LFB).

Locals in the area have been urged to stay away and keep their windows closed.

The brigadeâ€™s control office has taken 15 calls about the fire since 5.10pm on Tuesday.

LFB said it is likely firefighters will remain at the scene through the night.
