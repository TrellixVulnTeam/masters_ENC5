Runners up in 2013 and third-placed in 2017, Burkina Faso could continue their upward trajectory and further consolidate their place towards the top of the African game by beating a team who, despite their riches in talent, have never lifted the AFCON.

Beating finalists in 2019, manager Aliou Cisse has barely had his team firing on all cylinders thus far but, crucially, Senegal are grinding their way through the tournament. It might not be pretty but, frankly, teams who win the top prizes on the international stage rarely are.

If Senegal can continue to absorb pressure and rely on their individuals, a second final in quick succession could await.

The AFCON semi-final is scheduled for a 7pm GMT kick-off today, Wednesday, February 2, 2022.

The Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde will host it.

Dango Ouattara will miss out for Burkina Faso after his red card against Tunisia in a major blow for the side. Djibril Ouattara, meanwhile, will likely have to sit out too despite only making his first appearance of the tournament in the quarter-final following yet another injury.

For Senegal, no major changes are expected but it’ll be interesting to see whether or not Cheikou Kouyate is handed a start after his impressive cameo against Equatorial Guinea.

It seems to shame to go against Burkina Faso but Senegal have the look of a serious tournament team.
