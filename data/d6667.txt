A HAMPSHIRE sight loss charity is to mark 100 years of supporting visually impaired people across the county with a series of celebration events.

Open Sight Hampshire was established in 1922 as the Hampshire Association for the Care of the Blind and provides a variety of services to help adults and children who have a range of sight conditions.

The first centenary celebration will take place tomorrow (February 3) at the charity’s headquarters in Eastleigh with HM Lord-Lieutenant of Hampshire, Nigel Atkinson Esq, and Eastleigh Mayor, Cllr Cynthia Garton, in attendance. Ninety-nine-year-old Doris Fitall will also attend the event. Doris volunteered for Open Sight Hampshire in the 1980s, helping to take visually impaired people on outings. The reception will launch a series of events taking place throughout the year. In June, Marwell Hall & Zoo will host a special open day that will showcase Open Sight Hampshire’s history and include a cream tea and activities for all ages. The Eye Contact Expo, Hampshire’s only exhibition for the visually impaired, organised by Open Sight Hampshire, will take place at St Mary’s Stadium in September, and include various eminent speakers. Other smaller celebrations events will also take place including 1920s themed tea parties at the charity’s many social activity clubs. Chief executive David McKeigue said: “To reach a milestone such as a centenary is a remarkable achievement and testament to our dedicated staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to help our visually impaired clients." Community Sight Hubs offer technology support and independent living advice alongside an eye health awareness and sight loss prevention scheme in schools.
