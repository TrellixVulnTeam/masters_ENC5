CHELSEA’S hopes of signing Matthijs De Ligt this summer have reportedly received a boost.

The 22-year-old joined Juventus from Ajax in 2019 for a huge £67million.

But he has struggled to live up to that price tag in Italy and could now be on his way out the door at the end of the season.

Both Barcelona and Bayern Munich have been linked with the star.

And we reported last week how Thomas Tuchel was looking to bring him to Chelsea.

Now Tutto Sport have claimed that their chances could be boosted.

Following the January arrival of Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina, Juventus are not willing to offer £190,000-a-week Dutch star De Ligt the same wages to stay put.

That has reportedly led to his agent Mino Raiola ‘looking for a new club’ for his client in the hopes of sealing a summer exit from the Serie A giants.

He may be a more valuable asset at Stamford Bridge given the potential exodus of centre-backs from Thomas Tuchel's squad.

Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and club captain Cesar Azpilicueta are all set to see their Chelsea contracts expire in the summer.

The trio are continuing to wait on a suitable deal from the Blues as director Marina Granovskaia weighs up the pros and cons of keeping them.
