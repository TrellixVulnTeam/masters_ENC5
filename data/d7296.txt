Feb. 2 -- Tom Brady announced his retirement Tuesday, bringing an end to the most remarkable playing career the National Football League has ever seen. After 22 seasons during which Brady racked up five Super Bowl wins, three MVP awards, 15 Pro Bowl selections and a slew of career records that may never be broken, the legendary quarterback's resume and accomplishments speak for themselves.

But beyond the numbers, his unparalleled flair for late-game heroics and overcoming impossible obstacles also produced countless unforgettable memories. Many of those seemingly impossible obstacles weren't just built by an opposing defense or a dwindling game clock, but by Mother Nature.
