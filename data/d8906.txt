It takes more than a building collapse to stop Surfside sales in South Florida.

A seventh-floor unit at Arte, a pyramid-shaped boutique condo at 8955 Collins Ave., has sold for more than its $11.9 million asking price following a bidding war, Gimme has learned.

The unit went on the market for $10.5 million last March, but the price kept getting bumped up — to $11.5 million last May and then to $11.9 million in September. It closed this week for $12.22 million.

The 3,126-square-foot unit comes with three bedrooms and a 2,158-square-foot terrace with ocean views. The home opens to a private elevator landing with finger recognition entry.

Arte is where Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump rented while renovating their glam home on Indian Creek Island. It’s also where a mystery New York financier plunked down $33 million for a triplex penthouse.

Another buyer purchased a lower unit penthouse for $22.5 million in crypto, which the developers claimed might be the largest crypto real estate deal ever.

Designed by renowned Italian architect Antonio Citterio and built in 2019, Arte features just 16 units.

The developers are Giovanni Fasciano and Alex Sapir, the son of the late Soviet-born real estate mogul Tamir Sapir. Building amenities at Arte include rooftop tennis, a 75-foot indoor pool, an outdoor pool, direct beach access and a beachfront meditation studio and spa.

Douglas Elliman reps the building, “But we bought directly from developer Sapir Organization,” Ohad Fisherman of Societe Real Estate, who repped the buyer, said.
