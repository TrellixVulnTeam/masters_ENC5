Liberty Savage (Jessamy Stoddart) realised the true extent of Damon Kinsella’s (Jacob Roberts) addiction in Hollyoaks, after he gambled away their savings.

Damon, as viewers know, was on something of a winning streak in recent weeks, as he repeatedly used the gambling app on his phone.

With a trip to New York on the cards, he was feeling positive about the future for the first time in months.

Things, however, took a turn when he decided to host a gambling night in The Loft.

His reason for doing so was to get enough money in the bank to afford a proper place for himself and Liberty to live.

Scott Drinkwell (Ross Adams) warned him against gambling away everything that he and Liberty had, but Damon was adamant that he would come out victorious.

Unfortunately, Scott’s worst fears came to pass.

Yes, Damon’s winning streak came to a thunderous end, when he found himself the loser of the game.

But not only did he lose £3,000, he was also in severe debt, after Ethan Williams (Matthew James-Bailey) loaned him the money to continue playing.

Left with little choice, Damon returned home to The Love Boat, where he revealed to Liberty that he’d lost everything.

Liberty was livid, and she wasted little time in berating him for gambling with their future.

The bigger shock, however, came moments later, when Damon revealed that Ethan wants his money back immediately. That is, unless he gets his hands on The Emporium instead!

Will she give away her beloved business to get Damon out of debt? Will Ethan take over Liberty’s store?
