A woman online claimed that she recently banned her mother-in-law from her home.

Posting to Reddit's "Am I The A**hole" forum on Tuesday under the username u/alt_account_ad, the woman said that the ban went into effect following an incident involving a photo of her husband's ex.

So far, the post has received more than 8,200 upvotes and over 1,100 comments.

At the beginning of her post, the woman explained that she and her husband recently bought their first home together.

"[W]e're loving it and we're excited to decorate it together," she wrote. But, because her husband "travels a lot for work," she was tasked with starting the decoration process by herself.

She quickly realized, however, that she couldn't do it alone, so her mother-in-law offered to help.

"[Y]esterday, I got back from work at 8 p.m. and was shocked to see [that] one of the walls was full of framed pictures that MIL [mother-in-law] put there," the woman recalled. The wall contained photos from her husband's childhood, his graduation day and, to her horror, a wedding photo of her husband and his ex-wife.

"I lashed out at MIL, [and asked] what the h**l she put that picture on the wall for," the woman said.

The two argued back and forth until, finally, the woman kicked her mother-in-law out of the house. Later, after receiving a barrage of angry texts, the woman banned her mother-in-law from her home altogether.

When the woman's husband learned of the ban, he called her and urged her to "cancel" it, but she refused.

Of course, u/alt_account_ad isn't the first to struggle in her relationship with her mother-in-law. In 2008, psychologist Terry Apter revealed that she'd studied "hundreds of families" over the course of 20 years, and found that 60 percent of women "admitted the relationship with their female in-law caused them long-term unhappiness and stress," The Guardian reported.

Per Apter, mothers-in-law, specifically, are often a source of marital conflict because "men have a hard time backing up their wives when it means disagreeing with their mothers," Romper reported.

"They feel like they are forced to choose sides, their wives feel abandoned, and their mothers blame their daughters-in-law for changing their relationship with their sons," Romper continued.

In u/alt_account_ad's case, however, many Redditors didn't take her husband's feelings into account. Instead, they supported the woman's decision to ban her mother-in-law from her home and slammed her husband for not jumping to her defense.

"NTA [not the a**hole]," wrote u/Catatomical. "MIL knew exactly what she was doing and now she is succeeding in driving a wedge between you and your husband. He should 100 percent have your back on this and his mother should apologize."

"NTA [not the a**hole]. Hang up a photo of you and your ex and see how hubby feels about it. Oh, it's childish and immature? Well so is his mother. He needs to back you here. If he doesn't, is only going to continue to happen," said u/Liss78.

u/Melin_Lavendel_Rosa added: "This was a malicious power play from her. She hung that picture to show you that she will never accept you. It was a slap in the face. Your husband is a major AH [a**hole] too for not completely having your back."
