The former UKIP and Brexit Party leader is selling personalised video messages starting at £74 and claims nothing could say “I love you” more than a message from “Mr Brexit”.

But the packages, which rise to £400, are not aimed at those living in the capital.

In his promotional material for the clips he claims that while he is “treated as a hero” outside of London and “never has to buy a drink”, in the capital he has to pay for “full time security”.

The 57-year-old is selling the clips via personalised celebrity video messaging site Thrillz.

In his biography he claims: “Mr Brexit was a name given to me by Donald Trump and it has stuck.

“Outside of London, I get treated as a hero and never have to buy a drink.

“In London, I need full-time security! I was supposed to be a businessman, but the cause of our country breaking free from the grip of Brussels consumed me.”

He adds: “My life has always been controversial, but never boring. Having cheated death three times I live life to the full.”

The 57-year-old’s idea of romance did not go down well on social media.

One viewer commented: “How to kill the vibe on Valentines day. Here's a message from Nigel Farage. Just tell your other half you want to break up with them and save yourself the money.”

Another added a personalised message from Mr Farage was a “sure fire way to guarantee you won't get any thrills on valentines day”.
