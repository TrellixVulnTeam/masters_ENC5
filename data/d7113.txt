ASHLEY COLE is expected to continue in his role as England Under-21 assistant if he joins Frank Lampard's coaching staff at Everton.

New Toffees boss Lampard wants his former Chelsea team-mate Cole with him at Goodison Park as part of his backroom team.

But SunSport understands any move would likely see the ex-Arsenal defender combine the two roles for club and country.

That would allow Cole to continue in the position he took up in July as No2 to Young Lions chief Lee Carsley.

Cole, 41, is currently already combining that international duty with his work in Chelsea's academy.

The former left-back won 107 caps for his country.

And he also wants to be a boss in his own right in the future.

Cole said in November: “I am raring to go and waiting for my opportunity.

“But I’m just making sure I’m ready to go into it.”

The Three Lions legend worked with Lampard at Derby.

He then followed him to Chelsea in 2019.
