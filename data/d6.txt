LONDON, February 1. /TASS/. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Monday she had tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of her visit to Kiev, scheduled for Tuesday.

A few hours earlier, Truss addressed members of the UK House of Commons.

According to the UK Prime Minister’s office, Truss was in the delegation accompanying the country’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson during his visit to Ukraine.
