A retired psychologist, I wish I had been in possession of this column years ago to share with my patients. His words were possibly worth more than anything I may have accomplished in the many hours I spent trying to be of assistance to my patients.

Even more, though, Mr. Blow’s journey strikes home as it echoes some of my own setbacks and self-doubts. Not many of us, particularly those as accomplished as Mr. Blow, have the strength of character to share such vulnerability. His candor is reassuring to all of us who at varying points have felt like impostors.

Charles Blow’s column about his life changes after his brother died is a good lesson for all of us, especially men. It highlights how our culture has boxed men into a corner where they cannot show vulnerability.

He points out that life is a series of peaks and valleys. That is a constant theme in mindfulness practices. We are like an ocean and there will be waves. The waves of pain and suffering will come and go, but deep down there can be calm. You just have to sit with the pain and not cover it up.

Many of us know about the power of connection to others in an honest and open manner. Women have known this for ages. Men, on the other hand, would rather talk about sports, work and certainly not emotional stuff.
