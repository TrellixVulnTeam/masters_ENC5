On Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) encouraged the federal government to give $1.5 billion in taxpayer funds to New York for the state’s new “anti-gun task force” that he said would help combat “the scourge of gun violence.”

I guess Schumer either never read the Second Amendment or he doesn’t believe in the Bill of Rights. After what he’s done here, there is no third option.

LET’S ALL PAUSE FOR A MOMENT HERE WHILE SENATOR SCHUMER GOOGLES THE TERM “INFRINGEMENT.”

Schumer praised New York Democrat Governor (not elected) Kathy Hochul’s brand spanking new interstate Task Force on Illegal Guns, and virtue-signaled that it will only be helpful if the state received billions of taxpayer dollars in federal funding.

So now progressive Democrat governors are demanding all 150 million taxpayers from all 50 states subsidize a program that will only harm law-abiding gun owners and do absolutely nothing to criminals with guns.

Schumer said, “Communism is not dead. I am still here.” Kidding!

According to the New York Post, Schumer said, “I am pushing for $1.5 billion dollars in federal funds for the agency, so they can help with this work and do much more at the national level.” Does he not understand that the Second Amendment basically says that he can’t even hold a conversation on this? Shoveling out $1.5 billion to states so that they can violate the Second Amendment is unconstitutional.

Sometimes I think Democrats come up with really stupid things like this so that they can point to the opposition’s outrage and virtue signal about “the children.” Ever notice no matter what Democrats are asking for, it’s always about the children? “See how our Republican friends don’t want to stop gun violence that has taken the lives of many innocent children?” I like to say, “See how Chuck Schumer wants to put your children’s children into slavery debt for their entire lives?”

“Without the $1.5 billion … these plans will not have their full impact, and we need full impact to address the flow of these crime guns in our communities and across our state.”

New York could stem the flow of gun violence if they just pulled their collective heads out of the rear ends and actually prosecuted criminals with guns. How about reinstating bail to where it was before the crime rates started soaring in NYC?

You can’t allow riots to destroy a city all summer long, remove bail eligibility for many crimes, let Soros-funded progressive district attorneys not prosecute crimes that are politically correct and then act like your crime problems aren’t crime problems.

Schumer said that the task force is on his “front burner” and that he vowed to secure the federal money (coming from , the reader) this week.

Schumer has a habit of demanding that people who had nothing to do with it pay the debts of other people. He has been pushing almost daily for a long time now that student loan debt should be forgiven. He talks about how he wants to help people paying off student loans, that they legally took out and promised via signing the loan form to pay back. That means the senator from New York wants to pay for other people’s student loans even if you already paid yours off like I did. I paid off my student loans, and I had nothing to do with some deadbeat wanting me to pay for theirs.

President Joe Biden is slated to visit the Rotten Apple this week to meet with the new Mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, so that the two of them can talk about how to take away New Yorker’s gun rights while telling everyone else that they’re talking about gun violence in the city. Among other things, the meeting will consist of talks about getting even more funding for law enforcement officers. They’re also looking for money to pay for those community violence intervention programs, kinda like the one in Baltimore where a violence interventionist was shot and murdered two weeks ago. Why? Because it’s a stupid idea to send social workers out to deal with violent gangs unarmed.

“I look forward to welcoming President Biden to New York City next week and sitting down to discuss how we can work collaboratively to end the scourge of gun violence we are seeing on New York City streets,” Adams said in a statement. “The sea of violence comes from many rivers, and that’s why my Blueprint to End Gun Violence in New York City seeks to dam every river that feeds this greater crisis. Public safety is my administration’s highest priority, and we welcome the opportunity to display to President Biden how federal and local governments can coordinate and support each other in this fight to keep New Yorkers safe.”

Why can’t New York pay for their own programs? Why do they have to demand people who do not live inside New York pay for their spending sprees? The Constitution’s General Welfare Clause was all about this kind of thing. The Framers of the Constitution and state delegates held a lot of debates about people paying for programs who do not benefit from the program. They considered it theft, and so should we.
