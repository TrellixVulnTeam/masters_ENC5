BEIJING, February 2. /TASS/. The Olympic torch relay of the 2022 Winter Games kicked off on Wednesday in the Chinese capital of Beijing.

The solemn ceremony to launch a three-day relay was held at the Olympic park in the north of Beijing.

The relay is scheduled between February 2 and 4, 2022 (date of the opening of the Games) with the participation of 1,200 torchbearers. The three host zones of the Games Beijing’s city proper, Beijing’s Yanqing District and the city of Zhangjiakou in the neighboring Hebei Province are welcoming this traditional relay.

Due to the ongoing global spread of the novel coronavirus the route and distance of the Olympic torch relay was significantly reduced. The relay will be held without spectators in attendance along the whole distance.

The 2022 Winter Olympic Games in the Chinese capital of Beijing are scheduled to be held from February 4-20, while the Paralympic Winter Games will be held on March 4-13.

During the 128th IOC session in Kuala Lumpur on July 31, 2015, Beijing was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games making the Chinese capital the first city ever to host both the Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games (in 2008) as well as the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games (in 2022).

Beijing won the right to host the 2022 Olympics and Paralympics in a tight race, beating Kazakhstan’s Almaty in 2015, by chalking up 44 votes against its rival’s 40.
