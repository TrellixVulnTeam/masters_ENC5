The Issue: Maureen Callahan’s piece on the effect of cyberbulling after the death-by-suicide of Cheslie Kryst.

I just wanted to thank Maureen Callahan for her very well-written article regarding the suicide of Cheslie Kryst (“Regulate e-cesspit,” Feb. 2).

I am 63, so I’m not on Facebook, etc., but this high-tech cyberbullying is a subject that deserves much more attention.

These poor girls (in most cases) are terrorized 24/7. When I was a kid, at least I could go home for relief.

Callahan’s column on social media and cyberbullying was powerful.

Like her, I also do not care for Mark Zuckerberg. To me, he comes across as a phony, but will he and his colleagues in Big Tech be held accountable? In my opinion, it’s highly unlikely.

Cigarettes are one thing, and Callahan was correct in pointing that out, but Big Tech is a huge player in the political arena, and in my opinion, they will always be protected — to our everlasting shame.

I completely agree with Callahan’s column about the toxicity of social media and the irresponsibility of Big Tech. I raised two daughters and know all too well the damage that they cause.

One thing missing from the column was possible solutions. Short of eliminating these platforms altogether, which we know isn’t feasible, what would the solution be?

Algorithms to eliminate certain words aren’t effective. There are a million ways to bully and abuse. As a parent, I tried my best to limit and mitigate my kids’ exposure, but unless you treat your kids like inmates, it’s a losing battle.

Social media, by its very nature, brings out the worst in humanity. The ability to anonymously bully and abuse with no real-world consequences is a terrible power.

Too many weak and disturbed people find it irresistible. I fear that the genie is out of the bottle, and getting him back in may be impossible.

Callahan’s column was excellent. My hope is that parents see it, teachers see it and our supposed betters in Congress see it.

I am a senior citizen, and maybe because of my age, I saw this coming. It’s horrible to see what it’s doing to wonderful young people.

I offer my condolences to the friends and family of Cheslie Kryst.

It is heartbreaking to read about her suicide: such a beautiful, intelligent, accomplished and successful woman.

How is it that she could not find happiness with all these attributes?

One of her quotes is very telling: “Why work so hard to capture the dreams I’ve been taught by society to want when I continue to only find emptiness?”

When external goals are not fulfilling, it is time for an inward, not outward, look.

Television, media and platforms like Instagram are not sources of wisdom and guidance.

As Kryst turned 30, she stated she was “searching for joy and purpose on my own terms.” It is a tragedy she did not continue along this new path.

Callahan is always looking out for our younger female generation, while Big Tech is only looking for dollar signs.

She points to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s commander-in-chief, who claims his work is beneficial and can be a positive force in their lives. Don’t make me laugh, Mark.

Social media actually is nothing more than people spewing hate and ridiculing others in order to pump up themselves.

Fragile individuals, no matter how accomplished or how beautiful, are just as vulnerable as the lonely teen who struggles with school, friendships and even home life.

I’m a retired guy and just off-loaded Facebook the other day, and I don’t miss it for a second.

As beautiful as Cheslie Kryst was (and a former winner of Miss USA), she must have experienced some sort of unmanageable hardship.
