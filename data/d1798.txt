THE hotly anticipated psychological thriller Chloe is heading to our screens

The BBC One drama follows a social media-obsessed woman who goes undercover to solve a suspicious death.

Where is the BBC's Chloe set?

The six-part series is set in and around Bristol.

The thriller follows Becky Green who has been watching Chloe Fairbourne via her perfect social media images for some time, as an escape from her own life.

Becky can’t resist watching a life that contrasts so starkly with her own; a life spent caring for her mother, who has early-onset dementia, in their small seaside flat on the outskirts of Bristol.

However, when Chloe dies suddenly, Becky assumes a new identity and infiltrates the enviable lives of the dead woman's closest friends to find out what happened to her.

Where was the BBC's Chloe filmed?

The new psychological thriller was filmed by Mam Tor Productions for BBC One and Amazon Studios.

As the series is set in Bristol, it made sense to film there as well.

Chloe features an all-star cast who were seen shooting the show across the region.

Local newspapers reported the crew filmed in Bristol in May 2021.

Leading actress Erin Doherty, who plays Becky, and her co-star Michael Brandon Hall were spotted by Bristol Live taking over Quay Street Diner to film some scenes

Despite being set in Bristol, scenes were also filmed in Spring 2021 in Burnham, Buckinghamshire.

Locals reported seeing crew on a week long shoot in the area.

Locations used included Burnham-On-Sea beach, outside Burnham Pavilion, parts of Burnham’s South Esplanade at Quantock Court plus on top of Brean Down.

When is Chloe on TV?

There isn't long to wait for Chloe to start.

The show kicks off at 9pm on February 6, 2022 on BBC One.

You will also be able to watch episodes on the BBC iPlayer.
