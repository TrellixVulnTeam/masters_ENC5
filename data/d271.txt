0% intro APR for 14 months for purchases -- on top of the high cash back rate, this card also features a very competitive 0% intro APR offer. The go-to variable rate applies after the intro period expires. This can be a smart way to finance larger purchases, or simply if you find yourself in a temporary bind and want to avoid interest into 2023.

0% intro APR for balance transfers -- The same length 0% intro APR for 14 months applies for balance transfers. The go-to variable rate applies after the intro period expires. If you have credit card debt, you can transfer it to this card to avoid interest charges for well over a year on that transferred balance. Plus, you could use the cash back you earn from the card to help pay off any previous debt.

Earn up to 5% cash back -- Cardholders earn 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different places each quarter like Amazon.com, grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, up to the quarterly maximum of $1,500 on purchases and when you activate. Category activation is easy: Discover will send you an email before each quarter, and then you simply activate with one click. All other purchases earn 1% cash back.

Unlimited Cashback Match sign-up bonus -- This is my favorite perk of the card, and one that is unique and highly valuable. Discover will automatically match all the cash back youâ€™ve earned at the end of your first year for new cardholders, which can help lead to a truly incredible amount of cash back in your pocket.

$0 annual fee -- Credit cards packed with valuable features tend to charge a high annual fee, but not this card.
