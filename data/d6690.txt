Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) is the one time of the week when the Leader of the Opposition can ask direct questions to the Prime Minister, and it's in full view of the public eye. Boris Johnson will be interrogated by Sir Keir Starmer later today in the House of Commons, with all eyes on the PM's recent partygate scandal.

Mr Starmer will likely be continuing his deep dive into Sue Gray's update later today, when he comes face-to-face with Mr Johnson. The civil servant found "failures of leadership and judgment" inside Downing Street over 16 gatherings during Covid restrictions. The Prime Minister faced numerous calls to resign after Ms Gray's update was released. However, Mr Johnson refused to back down, insisting that everyone should wait for the Metropolitan Police's investigation to conclude.

After Mr Blackford, backbench MPs from either side of the House will get the opportunity to ask the PM a question. Some questions are more difficult to answer, with some Conservative MPs deliberately handing the PM easy questions to answer in a show of support. Everybody speaking in the House of Commons has to follow a set of rules and guidelines, which include referring to other MPs as 'the honourable gentleman' or 'the honourable lady'. The Speaker of the House - Sir Lindsay Hoyle - has the authority to remove MPs if they step out of line.
