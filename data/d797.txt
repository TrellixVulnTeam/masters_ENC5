Pete Davidson has been enjoying the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles with superstar girlfriend Kim Kardashian in recent weeks, but he’s now headed back to the reality of work on his new movie.

The Saturday Night Live comedian was spotted filming his new horror, The Home, in New York City on Monday and it’s safe to say, he looked miles away from the glamour of Hollywood.

Clearly going to great lengths for his transformation, Pete, 28, looked haunted – and pretty shifty to be honest – while in character sporting dark circles under his eyes and wearing an all black outfit with his hoodie pulled up.

He was in the middle of filming scenes alone at an empty petrol station but when the cameras stopped rolling, he was happy enough to flash a smile for photographers.

The Home is directed by James DeMonaco and sees him star as Max, who realises that the residents and caretakers at the retirement home where he works hide sinister secrets.

In addition to SNL, Pete’s work schedule looks pretty hectic as according to IMDB, he has several projects on the go including Good Mourning with a U, Meet Cute and Marmaduke.

It’s a wonder then how he has time to spend with new girlfriend Kim, 41, with the couple spotted out and about in LA last week.

The pair were joined by Kim’s sister Khloe Kardashian as they enjoyed a night out at an escape room and a KBBQ spot, while Pete also visited friends John Mulaney and Olivia Munn to meet their new baby boy Malcolm.

Meanwhile, a source recently said of the pair: ‘Kim and Pete are very in sync right now. They’re very in step with each other and the relationship is easy. They’re getting closer and closer and are a really great pair.’

They added to Us Weekly that they are ‘absolutely getting more serious.’

Another insider told E! News: ‘Kim and Pete are getting very serious. He has been hanging out at her house more. She’s smitten and the relationship is very exciting to her.’

A release date for The Home is yet to be announced.
