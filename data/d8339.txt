Hodgson has been appointed by the Hornets, who are on their third manager of the season and sit in the Premier League’s bottom three.

Ranieri was axed by the club in January after a poor run of form and Hodgson must now fight to keep Watford up.

Sir Elton is a fan of the club and is now their honorary life-president, after previously being chairman during the famous days of Graham Taylor.

“I haven’t spoken to either, but I would be really happy to speak to both,” said Hodgson.

“I regard Claudio Ranieri as a friend and have done since my days at Inter, when he was the manager of Fiorentina.

“He is not only a good coach, but a real gentleman and of course his CV goes without needing any mention at all.

“And of course Sir Elton John is someone I would love to speak to. So if ever he feels he wants to speak to me, I shall be available at any hour of the day or night.”
