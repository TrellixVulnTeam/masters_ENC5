President Donald Trump's administration has reportedly declassified intelligence that accuses China of offering to pay actors in Afghanistan to attack American soldiers.

Two senior Trump administration officials told Axios that the intelligence was included in the president's briefing on December 17.

Trump was also briefed on the information by National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien.

The officials told Axios that multiple agencies are working to corroborate the intelligence reports.

It's unclear if any other members of Congress or President-elect Joe Biden have been briefed on the matter, but Biden does have access to the President's Daily Brief.

According to Axios, Trump is not believed to have discussed the matter with China President Xi Jinping.

If the claims are confirmed to be true, it would escalate tensions between the US and China; however, if they are confirmed untrue, questions will be raised about the motivations of the sources who reported it.

Andrew Small, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, told Axios that it seems 'incongruous' that China would take such an action.

Small said that pursuing peace in Afghanistan is 'one of the extremely rare areas where the US and China still have a willingness to work together on an area of importance'.

'They know the drawdown is taking place. We're not in the context where anything else needs to happen to US troops in Afghanistan. There is no reason to create additional pressure on US forces,' Small added.

Last month it was reported that Trump had plans for a last-minute crackdown on China during the final weeks of his presidency.

Some of those restrictions included plans to sanction or restrict trade with more Chinese companies, government entities and officials for alleged complicity in human rights violations in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, or threatening US national security, Axios reported.

The new accusations against China also come just months after the New York Times reported that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly paid bounties to Taliban-linked fighters to kill US and coalition forces in Afghanistan.

The report represents a deadly escalation in Moscow's repeated efforts to undermine US policy, and came as the administration was seeking to find ways to extract itself from the decades-long war by making peace with the Taliban.

Trump was reportedly briefed on the activity months before it was the report was published in June, but the US took no evident action.

US Intel believed the operation to have been initiated by the notoriously violent Unit 29155 of the GRU, an arm of Russia's military intelligence agency.

In recent years, the unit has been linked to assassination attempts or revenge plots aimed at destabilizing the West.

Yet it would be the first time that it was known to have initiated attacks on Western troops, a major escalation of force against the US.

There were times when the bounties were in fact paid, according to the Times, although it did not specify if US troops stationed in Afghanistan were killed as a result of the Russian bounty payments. The money went to Islamist militants, the newspaper reported.
