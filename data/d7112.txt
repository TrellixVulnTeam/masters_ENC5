JACK Fincham’s daughter Blossom was rushed to hospital and spent eight hours in A&E.

The reality star’s ex Casey Ranger revealed the last few days had been a “living nightmare” after the two-year-old fell ill and required urgent medical attention.

Now home, she told her followers: “My brave little bear. The last few days have been a living nightmare. After spending 8 hours in A&E we were rushed away in an ambulance to the Royal London Hospital.

“After two nights there & 3 days of continuous tests, scans & X-rays, we are finally home. I am unable to put the last few days/nights/hours/minutes into words.”

She continued: “All I can say is how UNBELIEVABLY PROUD I am of my little lady & how incredibly grateful we are to be back in the comfort of our own home, sat on the sofa, candles burning, ready to eat some popcorn & watch Encanto with our cat.

“I am forever grateful that my bubba is on the mend & we will be spending the next few days at home so Blossom can get some rest; this means baking cakes, colouring in, painting & snuggling up on the sofa watching movies.”

Jack and Casey welcomed baby Blossom just months after his split from his Love Island beau Dani Dyer - who he won the competition alongside.

The pair have been at loggerheads since with Casey accusing Jack of not seeing enough of their daughter.

In December of last year, she claimed he had not seen her for eight months.

After his drug-driving charge was dropped he promised to "be a better person" for the sake of his daughter, who he welcomed with NHS worker Casey in January 2020.

"I really want to be involved in Blossom's life now," he told the Anything Goes podcast. "She's probably walking and talking. I'm missing out on all these things."
