An ex- Royal cop, who spent years protecting the Royals, has said that he’d have knocked Prince Andrew out if he’d been ordered to pick up his golf balls.

The Duke of York reportedly would order Royal Police to fetch his stray golf balls when he practised in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.

It was claimed he would have elite members of the Royal police squad acting as ball boys.

But, speaking to The Sun Online, one ex-Royal cop, Paul Page, said that if the Prince ordered him to fetch his balls he would “f****** knock him out”.

Page protected the Royals for six years and confirmed previous reports of the Duke’s behaviour and said he’d seen it, but not been asked to do so himself.

He told the Sun: “If he had asked me to pick up his golf balls, I'd have f***ing knocked him out.

"I'm from the East End, I wouldn't stand for that."

He described the Duke as a “f***** a****** and a bully” who “treated his staff like s***”.

Andrew is a keen golfer, but recently gave up his memberships of a number of prestigious golf clubs including The Royal and Ancient Club of St Andrews, where he’s been an honorary member since 1992.

But now he faces a public civil lawsuit over sex abuse allegations.

However, this is far from the first time that his behaviour towards staff has been called out.

In Nigel Cawthorne’s 2020 book ‘Prince Andrew: Epstein, Maxwell and the Palace’ he writes that an aide said: "I've seen him treat his staff in a shocking, appalling way.

"He's been incredibly rude to his personal protection officers, literally throwing things on the ground and demanding they 'f***ing pick them up'.

"No social graces at all. Sure, if you're a lady with blonde hair and big boobs, then I bet he is utterly charming."

Only a few days ago, another allegation emerged where it was claimed Andrew shouted at a female gardener because he felt a tree had been cut wrongly.

This came only days after being with his sex-abuse write by Virginia Giuffre.

Page also told the Sun that Andrew would let Ghislaine Maxwell visit him at the Palace without signing her in, a significant breach of Royal protocol.

Speaking on ITV ’s ‘Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile’ Page said that Maxwell visited the Prince up to four times in a single day.

Page said he suspected the pair “may have had an intimate relationship”.

Page was jailed in 2009 for his part in a £3m property scam, he said: "I've admitted my crimes, and I've served my time,".

This all comes a few weeks after Andrew failed in his efforts to dismiss claims against him.

Giuffre alleges that she was trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with the Royal.

Andrew denies all the claims against him.
