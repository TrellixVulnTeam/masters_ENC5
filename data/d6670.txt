The National Lottery is providing up to £2 million to subsidise over 150,000 tickets across the UK.

During March, National Lottery players can get two for the price of one theatre tickets for performances of shows including Matthew Bourne’s Nutcracker! at Mayflower Theatre and Dracula, Sheila’s Island, The Rise & Fall of Little Voice and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde at MAST Mayflower Studios.

The campaign encourages the public to support local theatres as they recover from the pandemic and tickets are on sale now from loveyourlocaltheatre.com

Nutcracker follows Clara’s journey through a shimmering, ice-skating wonderland to the scrumptious candy kingdom of Sweetieland, influenced by the lavish Hollywood musicals of the 1930’s. Tchaikovsky’s glorious score combines with Matthew Bourne’s dazzling choreography in this re-imagined production, which runs from March 29 to April 2.

Sheila’s Island is a sparkling new comedy from writer Tim Firth (Calendar Girls, Kinky Boots, The Band), starring Olivier Award winner Sara Crowe (Private Lives, Calendar Girls, Four Weddings and a Funeral) and Judy Flynn (The Brittas Empire, Dinnerladies). See them unwittingly on an island in the Lake District during a team building exercise from March 15 to 19.

TV favourite Shobna Gulati (Coronation Street, Dinnerladies, Loose Women), British soap royalty Ian Kelsey (Emmerdale, Casualty) and ‘the girl of a thousand voices’ and two-time Drama Desk Award Nominee Christina Bianco appear in Olivier Award winning comedy drama The Rise & Fall of Little Voice from March 23 to 26.

Gripping production The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde runs from March 28 to 30.
