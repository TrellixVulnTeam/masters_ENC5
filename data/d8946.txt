Carnival barkers in the media is going absolutely insane as they try their best to steal any glory at all that may so much as touch President Biden. Think about it. How many stories has Palmer Report brought you about Biden’s accomplishments? I wrote one the other day myself about all Biden has done for our nation’s farmers. Do you HEAR any of this on TV? The screens are silent.

However, they’re NOT silent on Biden’s “failures” — or what the media pretends earnestly are his failures. It is even happening with the Supreme Court. I see far more stories talking about Biden’s pick ( who hasn’t even been named yet) in a negative light than a positive one.

Shortly before I sat down to write this article, I received an alert. I am signed up for pretty much every alert about politics one can possibly get. This one was interesting. The headline was about how Biden bungled the picking of his nominee. And it was from a well-known media organization. Just think about it. How many articles do you see about Ted Cruz and his nauseating racism in regards to Biden’s selection?

Perhaps there are a few — but far more articles seem solely written to cause division. What about the supposed “poll” done that says most of the country wants Biden to select from the general population? The poll was from such a small and piddling amount of people, and it was just pathetic.

And WHY did we not see these types of headlines when the handmaid was up for the highest court in the land?

It makes my stomach turn. And here is a warning — in the coming weeks, the media will do their best to keep this ugly talk going. Please don’t buy into their disgusting game. All of this is for drama. That’s all. The media — many of them — are basically reality shows — and they want the flashiest, most lurid headlines they can possibly get.
