Alexander Vindman, the Army colonel who was a chief witness in President Donald J. Trump’s first impeachment trial, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against Mr. Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr.; Rudolph W. Giuliani; and two other top Trump White House aides, accusing them of running a coordinated intimidation and retaliation campaign to stop him from testifying.

The suit, which was filed in federal court in Washington, said that the defendants had spread false claims that Mr. Vindman was a Ukrainian spy, leaked classified information to undermine his credibility, falsely accused him of perjury and had him and his twin brother fired from their White House positions.

“This campaign of intimidation and retaliation has had severe and deeply personal ramifications for Lt. Col. Vindman,” the suit said, adding that Mr. Vindman had sustained “significant financial, emotional, and reputational harm” for testifying against Mr. Trump at the impeachment trial.

The suit, which did not say how much money Mr. Vindman was seeking, added: “It also left a stain on our democracy.”
