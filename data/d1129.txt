"[Foreign Minister] Lavrov sent messages to his NATO counterparts, including [US Secretary of State Anthony] Blinken, on the issue of how NATO understands the fundamental, key principle of the indivisibility of security. And there is no answer to this message from the West, from no one. Therefore, it is wrong to present the case saying that we sent them a written response", the diplomatic source stressed.
