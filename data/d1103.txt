In early hours on January 31, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) reportedly targeted the Damaskus outskirts. The attack was repelled by the Syrian Air Defence Forces and resulted in some material damage.

According to the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), the Israeli missile aggression was carried out from the direction of Riyaq, east of Beirut, at about 03:05 a.m. local time.

Syrian air defenses intercepted the hostile missiles and downed some of them, a military source told SANA.

No footage was provided to support the report.

Israel has recently decreased its military activity over the Syrian territory. The reported attack near Damascus is the first in 2022.

Earlier, it was reported that Israeli military officials began talks with Russian army officers to prevent any further escalation. On January 24, the joint Russian-Syrian aerial patrol along the Golan Heights and the Euphrates River also pushed the Israeli military to limit its air campaign in Syria.

The last Israeli attack targeted the port of Lattakia. In December, Israel struck the port twice. The strikes provoked Russia to increase its military presence on the Syrian coast.

The Syria’s and Russia ‘s diplomatic and military efforts aimed to contain Israeli aggression seemed to be successful, but they are likely not enough to end it.
