Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is currently hiding at an undisclosed location.

Justin Trudeau and his family were moved to a secret location on Saturday due to security reasons amid anti-vax protests.

Anti-vax protesters and truckers late Friday night descended on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.

However, Trudeau accused the trucker convoy of “hateful rhetoric” and “violence toward citizens” during a broadcast from his hiding place.

Trudeau also said he prefers violent BLM protests because he “agrees with their goals.”
