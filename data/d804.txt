The Formula 1 off-season has been dominated by concern about Lewis Hamilton’s future in the sport, after the controversial Abu Dhabi finale in which Max Verstappen took his maiden world championship.

The 2021 campaign was one of the most sensational in F1’s 70-year history. The spectacle of two incredible athletes performing at the very peak of their powers, combined with their public personas being the antithesis of one another, produced an enthralling storyline which millions of fans old and new were truly emotionally invested in.

That such a captivating season ended with chaos, protest, and acrimony after the the two men had entertained the world with their stunning quality of driving, was a travesty only Formula 1 could allow itself to stumble into.

Race Director Michael Masi was put in an incredibly difficult position when Nicholas Latifi spun his Williams into the barriers with a few laps of the race remaining at Yas Marina, but the Australian’s unprecedent handling of the safety car period which followed thrust Formula 1 into a crisis which has damaged the sport’s image and could ultimately cost it the continued participation of its most successful driver of all-time.

With Hamilton leading the Abu Dhabi race on worn hard tyres and Verstappen in second on fresh softs, Masi made the extraordinary decision to allow only the lapped cars separating the pair to un-lap themselves before the restart. That meant one final lap of racing with Verstappen right on Hamilton’s gearbox, the Mercedes man rendered a sitting duck, and essentially gifted Verstappen the title.

Make no mistake, the timing of the decision Masi had to make was awful. The other two options — finishing the race behind the safety car, or leaving the lapped cars in the way — would have had the opposite outcome, effectively guaranteeing Hamilton victory. The fact he had a matter of minutes to make the call only ratcheted up the pressure, too.

The option Masi eventually went with, though, was the most artificial. The most engineered for drama. The reality TV option rather than the sporting integrity choice. That is what has rankled with so many fans, pundits, and drivers alike in the aftermath, and is the reason that the FIA was forced to admit that F1’s image had been “tarnished” by Masi’s running of the race. Even if Masi’s call was technically permitted by the rulebook, the call seemed to go against spirit of the regulations, and of fair racing as a whole.

The FIA is motorsport’s governing body, overseeing the running of all competitions, including managing F1’s rulebook. Mercedes only dropped their appeal against the race result at Yas Marina, which would potentially have ended up in a highly damaging legal case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, after the FIA announced it was to undertake “a detailed analysis and clarification exercise for the future with all relevant parties.”

Mercedes responded by saying the team would “hold the FIA accountable” for its investigation. The “disillusioned” Hamilton’s future in the sport is believed, at least in part, to rely on the outcomes of the governing body’s investigation.

That investigation is far from straightforward, though. The FIA must balance a variety of complicated, and often conflicting, factors in order to reach an end stage which satisfies different stakeholders with wildly differing points of view.

There must be four overarching goals for the investigation:
• To pacify Hamilton and Mercedes and keep them on board.
• To make sure the same controversy is not repeated in future.
• To explain the process and changes transparently to fans.
• To avoid making it look as though Verstappen’s win was a con.

One of the most tempting and easiest conclusions for the FIA to come to would be to scapegoat Masi, to lay the blame at one man’s door, and move on without him. But that in itself would not solve the problem, because the structures and situation around Masi — including putting all of the work running a Formula 1 Grand Prix entails on one man’s shoulders, and allowing team principals to lobby him throughout a race — would remain the same.

What’s more, there is no obvious replacement for Masi in the rest of the FIA’s ranks. Booting him out and replacing him with somebody unqualified could lead to a similar situation further down the line, where an inexperienced Race Director makes an incorrect call leaving the audience up in arms, and we all end up back at square one.

The FIA also needs to be very careful with how it frames the ‘story’ when it announces its conclusions. It must find a balance between appeasing Mercedes, Hamilton, and the sport’s fans, without denigrating Verstappen’s win or essentially declaring that Hamilton was 2021’s ‘rightful’ champion. To do so might seem to fair to some, but it would completely eviscerate the sport’s reputation, and plunge F1 into a new era of distrust, angst and callousness that would cause it irreparable harm. Mercedes understood the same when it dropped its appeal rather than dragging the entire sport’s future through the courts.

What happened in Abu Dhabi was not Verstappen or Red Bull’s fault, and the hard work and excellent level of performance they put in not just in 2021 but in the seasons prior to catch up to Mercedes should not be disparaged. At the same time, though Hamilton is more likely than not to return to F1 for 2022, he owes the sport nothing whatsoever and his participation should not be taken for granted by those in charge. They need to make him feel as though real, tangible change will be made for him to be able to move forward as F1’s primary ambassador.

All of the above must be balanced, once again, against the quite contradictory need for the FIA to be fully transparent in order to regain the confidence and trust of teams, personnel, drivers and fans. This all might seem like an impossible job, and perhaps it is, but the FIA put itself in this position and as custodians of Formula 1, and they must be the ones who find a way out of it.

Earlier this month the FIA released a timeline outlining the steps its investigation will go through. Its initial analysis will be presented to the F1 Commission, which includes the teams, in early February before “final decisions” are announced publicly at the World Motor Sport Council on 18 March.

Those final decisions are going to be crucial not just for explaining for the past, but for making sure the future is founded on a basis of fair racing, transparency, and accountability.
