Republicans from Kentucky and Pennsylvania defied a presidential order to provide immediate financial relief for struggling Americans.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) prevented the Democratic Party from voting and approving an $892 billion CCP (Chinese Communist Party) Virus stimulus package.

This is the second day McConnell and his supporters have delayed badly needed financial relief to struggling families and individuals affected by government restrictions to help contain the deadly disease.

Toomey refused to support giving away taxpayer money to some Americans who allegedly did not need the money.

“Congress should continue helping workers who have lost their jobs but blindly borrowing more than $600 billion so we can send $2,000 checks to millions of people who have not lost any income is terrible policy,” Toomey said on Twitter. “I will not consent to a vote on that.”

McConnell introduced his own measure on Tuesday that would tie an increase in the stimulus checks to the repeal of a liability shield (FCC Section 230) used by tech companies and the creation of a commission to investigate the 2020 election.

“The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues that President Trump linked together just because Democrats are afraid to address two of them,” McConnell said, according to The Hill. “The Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of Democrats’ rich friends who do not need the help.”

This further delay prompted the publication to predict Congress might be unable to approve the CCP Virus stimulus package before the 116th Congress can hold its last session on Jan. 3.

President Trump believes there is no excuse for the GOP to fail to deliver the stimulus package and ordered all party members to support the bill unconditionally.

“Republicans must support the $2,000 payments and must FIGHT the crooked presidential election,” he said on Twitter. “We won big!”

President Trump previously criticized McConnell and other Republicans for not doing everything in their power to stop military bases that honor Confederate historical figures from being renamed.

“Weak and tired Republican ‘leadership’ will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass,” he said on Twitter. “Say goodbye to VITAL Section 230 termination, your national monuments, forts (names!) and treasures (inserted by Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren), 5G, and our great soldiers being removed and brought home from foreign lands who do NOTHING for us.”

The president was very disappointed by the GOP’s lackluster leadership and urged party members to respect his wishes. He also proposed a change of leadership in both chambers of Congress.

“We need new and energetic Republican leadership,” he said on Twitter. “This cannot stand.”
