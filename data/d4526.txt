Last week we speculated that whoever leaked the Breyer announcement early was probably someone who wanted to make sure he did retire. Well it turns out to be Biden’s Chief of Staff, Ron Klain:

NEWSMAX – White House chief of staff Ron Klain told a “limited number” of people that Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer was retiring, shortly before the news was actually leaked publicly, Sen. Dick Durban, D-Ill., disclosed on Monday.

Durbin, the Senate Judiciary chair, told reporters that he got a “surprise” call from Klain last Wednesday morning telling him that Breyer was retiring but asking him to keep it private, The Daily Mail reported.

“That’s what confidential on Capitol Hill leads to, I guess,” Durbin said.

“Never tell anything to Biden or Ron Klain,” quipped Washington Examiner columnist Tim Carney.

Before this happened, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens had called on Klain to resign as Biden’s chief of staff. He said he should be replaced by someone like Tom Daschle, former Senate majority leader.

NBC News was among the first to break the story of Breyer’s retiring on Wednesday last week, citing “people familiar” with the justice’s thinking in its reporting.

But Breyer was months away from announcing the news himself, according to the Washington Examiner.

Breyer informed Biden of his decision to retire in a Jan. 27 letter. He will serve until the summer.
