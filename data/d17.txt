Westminster leader of the SNP Ian Blackford said he has no regrets over being thrown out of the Commons for accusing Boris Johnson of having “wilfully misled Parliament”.

Levelling accusations of lying is against the rules of the Commons.

Mr Blackford said that accusing the Prime Minister of lying was something he would do again as he repeated the accusation outside the chamber.

He said: “I mean, at the end of the day, this is a Prime Minister that we know has misled parliament.

"And all I did was stand up and speak truth to power and apparently in the House of Commons, that’s not permissible.”
