Last week, White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients said he hopes we will get to where COVID-19 is acceptable and could be considered endemic when “it doesn’t disrupt our capability to function in society in a relatively normal way.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top White House medical adviser said, when asked what an acceptable situation is regarding SARS Cov-2 and COVID-19 said, “the important point to make is that we are not there right now.”

In a White House Covid briefing Wednesday Fauci said: “We want to make it low enough so that it doesn’t disrupt our capability to function in society in a relatively normal way. We do that with other respiratory viruses.”
