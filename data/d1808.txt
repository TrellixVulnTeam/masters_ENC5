BARCELONA are considering terminating Ousmane Dembele's contract after they failed to offload him in the January transfer window.

The Frenchman was offered to a host of clubs around Europe including Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.

It also looked at one stage as though PSG were closing in on his signature on deadline day.

But that move was scuppered by Financial Fair Play regulations as the Catalan giants wound up with him still on their books.

And now, according to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona are thinking about trying to get him off their books immediately by ripping up his existing deal.

Dembele will become a free agent at the end of the season when his contract expires.

But there are now reports the club could look to take "drastic measures" to get his wages off their books.

A meeting will take place on Tuesday between Barca chiefs as they discuss what to do with Dembele's £210,000 a week salary.

And it is thought some within the discussion will call for his contract to be terminated.

Dembele arrived at Barca from Borussia Dortmund in 2017 for a massive £135.5million.

He is currently the fourth most expensive player in the history of football.

But the 24-year-old has failed to live up to the hefty price tag he garnered when arriving at the Nou Camp.

In 129 appearances for Barca, he has managed just 31 goals.

There are reports that Chelsea's interest in the January window was in fact an attempt to secure him as a free agent in the summer.

And talks between the player and club could be facilitated by the fact that Blues boss Thomas Tuchel coached Dembele at Dortmund.

Meanwhile, Barcelona are currently struggling in LaLiga, sitting fifth in the table after 21 games.
