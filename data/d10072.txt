Tired of having “Dr.” Fauci running every little aspect of your life? Tired of having the scratchy-voiced, wizened bureaucrat saying that you can do this, can’t do that, and must do some other random thing, rarely with an explanation and even more rarely consistent over time?

Well, so is Bo Hines, a North Carolina congressional candidate, who took the advice of Daily Wire host Michael Knowles and signed an awesome pledge that he’s trying to get every member of the GOP to sign and announced it on Twitter, saying:

“Every federal candidate and sitting Member of Congress in the country needs to sign the “Michael Knowles Public Health Protection Pledge!”

The pledge, created by the well-dressed Daily Wire host, was first posted to Twitter as a semi-joke, semi-serious slap in the medical tyrant’s face, with Michael Knowles posting it after joking about such a pledge in one of his podcast episodes. In the tweet, he said:

I will not vote for any federal candidate in 2022 who does not promise to investigate and defund Dr. Fauci. And you shouldn’t either.

Tag your congressmen, senators, and candidates, and tell them to sign the Public Health Protection Pledge!

The Hines and Knowles pledge itself says:

I, ­___________________________, pledge to the taxpayers of the State or Commonwealth of ____________________________ and to the American people that I will: 1.) Vote to subpoena Dr. Anthony Fauci in order to investigate any corrupt activities to which he may be party regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the numerous and demonstrable lies that he has told to the United States Congress and the American people regarding the virus, its origin, and the efficacy of public health measures to fight it. 2. Sponsor and vote for legislation that reduces the salary of the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Chief Medical Advisor to the President of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, to $0.00.

And Hines isn’t the only candidate to have signed Michael’s anti-Fauci pledge. Patrick Witt, Jake Baquette, Robby Starbuck, Carolina Serrano, Christian Collins, Jonah Schulz, and Andrew McCarthy did too, both posting their signed copies on Twitter to raise awareness of the issue:

Though that’s only a few people who are running for Congress, it’s still a major step. Up till now, anti-Fauci sentiment has been high but those in leadership have done little about it. They occasionally stoke anti-Fauci sentiment but haven’t done much of anything to take action against him.

But now, with some of the best MAGA candidates out there signing a pledge in which they vow to fire Fauci and then encouraging their fellow Republicans to do the same indicates that a storm is on the horizon; we might have finally reached the point where the Republicans who will soon have the reigns of power will start to use it and go after those who have made life so miserable for us.

If I were Fauci, I’d be worried; this pledge, though it may have started as a joke, is a big deal.
