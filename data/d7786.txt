January 6 Committee member Adam Schiff reminded us today that Trump was waving a get-out-of-jail card to anyone who would join this coup attempt. Take a look at Representative Schiff’s tweet below. He said that Trump’ also reminded us of his “dangerous unfitness. When a despot threatens democracy, believe him:”

‘Trump just doubled down, saying he would “absolutely” pardon those responsible for Jan 6. People who beat police officers. Who wanted to hang his VP. He called them patriots. Every day he reminds us of his dangerous unfitness. When a despot threatens democracy, believe him.’

Trump’s “if” he gets reelected comment was a huge peek inside of his brain. This may be the first time that Donald has admitted he might not win a 2024 election.
