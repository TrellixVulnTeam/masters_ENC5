Greg Rutherford’s fiancee has only just finished feeding their baby daughter when he refuses to rule out another tilt at Olympic bobsleigh glory.

“That was the zip on the bags, and she’s just left me!” jokes the 35-year-old after admitting he has already considered trying to make the Winter Games for a second time.

It is just days since Rutherford failed in his first attempt and he is sitting in his Buckinghamshire home talking about committing another four years to a sport he took up only in April.

He and fiancee Susie Verrill have been watching a documentary chronicling his unlikely attempt to qualify for the Beijing Games.

Given she admits in the film to trying to sabotage his move into the sport before it began – asking one of their friends to help “quash” the idea – it is probably for the best that she has left the room.

She is also not the only reason why some will think Rutherford is crazy to be considering continuing his quest to become only the second man to win Olympic gold at both a summer and winter Games.

As One Last Push lays bare, his initial foray into the world of four-man bobsleigh could hardly have gone more awry. In his first proper outing in November, he fractured a shoulder, preventing him making his competitive debut until the new year.

Poor performances by his team-mates during his absence then meant, by the time he returned, qualifying for Beijing was all but impossible.
