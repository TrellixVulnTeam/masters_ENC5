Robert Halfon, Conservative MP for Harlow and chairman of the Education Select Committee, expressed concerns over a potential “epidemic of educational poverty” as school openings are delayed. He told BBC Breakfast: “I do worry very much about children not being in school. I understand we have to balance the risks of coronavirus, absolutely, and do everything possible to keep staff and children safe, but I also worry about the impact of lost learning on the children. "This is very, very, very difficult all around and I think the impact on educational learning and mental health is perhaps the two most important things because these are things that are very difficult to deal with.“We want to deal with coronavirus but we don’t want an epidemic of educational poverty and mental health crises amongst young people in our country.”
