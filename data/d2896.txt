Winds of up to 92mph wreaked havoc across the UK at the weekend as Storms Malik and then Corrie hurtled across the Atlantic.

Two people died, thousands were left without power some schools were closed and train services hit by high winds.

In another example of the impact of the high winds a plane coming into London airport at shortly after midday on Monday from Aberdeen was captured on video.

The footage posted by live streaming platform Big Jet TV showed the aircraft sway from side to side as it touches down in strong winds which forced the “touch and go” manoeuvre meaning the pilot had to take off again and re-approach for a second attempt.

Witnesses said paint dust can be seen coming off the tail of the plane as it hit the ground during the shaky aborted landing attempt.

In the video, which has been viewed more than 40,000 times online, the plane can be seen swaying in the wind as it makes its approach into Heathrow.

The plane rocks from side to side as it hits the tarmac before it leans heavily onto its left side, balancing on the left wheels.

As the pilot battles to prevent it from flipping, the tail of the plane appears to touch the tarmac before the aircraft leaves the runway and heads back into the air for another attempt.

A British Airways spokesman said: “Our pilots are highly trained to manage a range of scenarios, including extreme weather conditions, and our flight crew landed the aircraft safely. Our customers and crew all disembarked as normal.”
