A SHOCKED mum has spoken out after her daughter was allegedly threatened with a knife by another child.

Sophie Stevenson, a full time carer from Gedling, said she was horrified after a young boy reportedly came up to her 12-year-old daughter and threatened to "slit her throat" before waving a knife.

The alleged confrontation happened on January 2 when her daughter Grace Wade was hanging out with a group of friends on Conway Avenue, the mum told Nottinghamshire Live.

It was reported to the police and prompted an investigation, the force confirmed.

Ms Stevenson, 29, said: "I was shocked when I heard about it.

"She was just hanging out with her group of girls near Carlton le Willows Academy.

"And it was just after the New Year's when he went to my daughter and told her that he was going to slit her throat.

"He then pulled the knife out and started waving it around."

The worried mum said that the alleged knife threat left her daughter traumatised.

She added: "She does not want to go to school anymore, and it definitely changed her to how she was before.

"She does not sleep properly at night."

The incident has been reported to both the police and school shortly after it happened, the mum said.

Inspector Chris Jury, district commander for Gedling, said: “A boy has been identified and spoken with alongside his appropriate adult in relation to this incident and an investigation into it remains ongoing.

“Officers have updated the victim’s parents on the progress with the enquiries.

“We take any reports of knife crime extremely seriously and will always thoroughly investigate any reports made to the force to keep the people of Nottinghamshire safe.”

A spokesperson from Carlton le Willows Academy said: “Publicised cases of knife crime around the country are a concern to every school and we continue to do all that we can to support police and external partners locally to minimise the risks of knife crime within the community.”
