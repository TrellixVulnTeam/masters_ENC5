India is looking to break the dominance of Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android by creating their own operating system. There have been several attempts to topple the two giants, but none have attained desirable results so far.

Two of the biggest operating systems, Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS, dominate the smartphone market. And the Indian government has decided to change things up.

Rajeev Chandrasekhar, India’s junior Information and Technology (IT) minister, claimed in a recent interview that the government is in talks with IT firms to develop an indigenous operating system (OS), reports World is One News.

“There is no third one. Therefore, in a lot of ways there is tremendous interest in MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology) and in the Government of India to even create a new handset operating system. We are talking to people. We are looking at a policy for that,” Chandrasekhar told PTI news agency.

According to him, the government is looking for talents in the start-up and academia ecosystems to help create the OS.

“If there is some real capability then we will be very much interested in developing that area because that will create an alternative to iOS and Android which then an Indian brand can grow,” Chandrasekhar said.

Android and iOS have dominated the mobile OS market in recent years. According to Statcounter, a firm that analyses online traffic, Android OS has a 70 percent market share, with iOS coming in second with 29.24 percent.

Microsoft attempted to break the stranglehold by purchasing Nokia in order to market Windows phones, but it failed horribly.

After failing to break into India’s mobile market with low-cost smartphones, Mozilla’s Firefox OS was cancelled. Tizen, a Linux Foundation project, similarly failed to attract an audience.

The Chinese government has recommended the Linux-based Kylin OS for locals, but it has yet to gain traction.

Astra Linux, on the other hand, is solely available to Russia’s military.
