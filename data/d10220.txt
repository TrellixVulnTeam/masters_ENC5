TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Authorities are investigating the death of an 18-year-old inmate at the Pima County jail on Tuesday.

County Sheriff's officials said Sylvestre Inzunza was booked into jail on Jan. 27 on suspicion of aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, auto theft and kidnapping.

He was being held on a $75,000 bond.

A corrections officer at the jail located Inzunza unresponsive in his cell around 5:30 a.m. and called for medical assistance, according to sheriff's officials.
