— O’Toole open to changes: Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole reportedly told MPs yesterday that he would be open to changing policies, including ones he campaigned on just six months ago, if he survives today’s review of his leadership. He and close advisers and loyalists — including deputy whip James Bezan and MP Michael Chong — spent yesterday calling MPs to seek pledges of support.

A number of Conservative parliamentarians did rally around the leader yesterday, including deputy leader Candice Bergen and Alberta MP Michelle Rempel Garner, who both made statements in support of O’Toole. Others, meanwhile, have turned on him — including Alberta MP Garnett Genuis, who had in September supported O’Toole but yesterday told reporters “the leader’s position is untenable.”

— Kady O’Malley writes iPolitics AM that “there’s still no immediate end in sight to the gridlock that has effectively shut down the capital since the self-proclaimed ‘Freedom Convoy’ rolled into town over the weekend to protest vaccine mandates and other pandemic-imposed public health restrictions, but time may be about to run out on Erin O’Toole’s tenure as Conservative leader, courtesy of a caucus-triggered confidence vote set to take place today.”

— Quebec scraps anti-vax tax: Quebec Premier François Legault has scrapped plans for a “tax” on the unvaccinated, just weeks after first announcing the measure. The premier said he was abandoning the idea to impose a monetary penalty on those who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine in order to protect “social cohesion” in Quebec. He also announced that restrictions on gyms and sports activities would be eased.

— Provinces mull lifting restrictions: Alberta Premier Jason Kenney says he hopes to begin lifting COVID-19 health measures by the end of February. Next door in Saskatchewan, meanwhile, a nurses union said that morale is in “free fall” and emphasized that now is not the time to scrap vaccine mandates. Ontario‘s science advisors, meanwhile, have informed that province that easing restrictions will increase COVID cases.

— Ottawa protests getting expensive: The ongoing anti-vaccine protest in Ottawa has begun to rack up costs to residents, the police, and local businesses, as the downtown core remains at a standstill. “Who do we sue?” asked one small business owner in an interview with the Canadian Press. She has lost at least three days’ income. Protests enter their fifth day today, and as CBC News reports, residents are beginning to worry about how it all might end.

— Putin speaks: In his first public comments on Ukraine in almost six weeks, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the West has ignored his country’s security concerns and reiterated that if Ukraine were to join NATO it could lead to war. He made the comments yesterday in a joint Moscow news conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Canada yesterday changed its travel advisory to warn against all travel to Ukraine “due to ongoing Russian threats and the risk of armed conflict.”

Putin also accused the U.S. of trying to draw Russia into war. Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians are training for war as fears of an invasion grow.

— Denmark lifts COVID measures: Denmark has ended all domestic COVID measures, including the wearing of face masks and vaccine passports to enter venues. It is the first country in the European Union to do so. The government said that, despite the still-high number of cases, the virus no longer qualifies as a “critical threat” due to the high vaccination rate. (More than 80 per cent of the population over five have at least two doses, while more than 60 per cent have also received boosters.)
