New York had to borrow $11 billion from the federal government to pay unemployment claims during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is still $9.3 billion remaining on that loan, which shows up as a deficit in the Unemployment Insurance fund and drives a higher contribution rate for the state’s businesses. At a time when New York is flush with cash, no mention has been made of paying down the unemployment insurance borrowing to relieve the stress on New York’s businesses — including those that have had no layoffs during the pandemic. Instead, the state’s response is to kick the can down the road by postponing unemployment payment increases while writing really big checks to areas that will help Gov. Kathy Hochul win re-election in November.

“I really think we need to look at what we spend our money on here in New York state,” Borrello said on the Senate floor. “We have a huge budget surplus. We have unspent federal relief money and we have yet to address the fundamental problem that every single employer in New York state is paying more for unemployment insurance than they ever have. According to the Business Council, it’s going to take more than a decade to make up that $9 billion shortfall if some of that money from the fed government isn’t diverted to that fund. A decade on the backs of every single employer in New York state. So this is kind of like a bucket of water in the ocean. Happy to have it. Glad we’re doing it. But we need to step up and fill that crater and make sure that $9 billion deficit is not a burden on our already overburdened businesses in New York state.”
