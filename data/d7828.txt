Not so many years ago, having gray hair was a symbol of aging and not much more. But times have changed, and today gray hair is vindicated and shown with pride. Many women wear their gray hair with a lot of self-respect and look amazing.

1. “Turning 47 soon and refusing to dye my gray hairs”

2. “I’ve had gray streaks since I was a child, but I’m finally letting them shine at 30. 4 months of growth so far!”

3. “Thank you all for sharing your magic and beauty to help me feel magical and beautiful!”

4. “Growing out my gray — I kind of like it.”

6. We love this look.

7. “I’m 28 years old, but I’d wager that about 1/6 or 1/5 of my hair is entirely white (not gray...white). It makes me feel very mystical.”

8. “It’s my birthday, and my grey hair is showing more than ever.”

9. “I’m in love with my silver streaks. As much as I’d love to dye my hair again, I would miss my tinsel hair too much!”

10. “These white ones do what they want. And I let them...’cuz there ain’t enough mousse, gel, or Aqua Net in the world to tame them.”

12. “What is happening here? Everyone says I’m warm but look at that gray hair coming in.”

14. “I dyed my premature grey hair since I was about 20. I finally decided to let it fly free at 35.”

16. “I’ve been really feeling my natural grey hair today that’s more noticeable with wet hair, and I wanted to share.”
