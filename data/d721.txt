Another example of how ‘net zero’ dogma is going to be highly disruptive and expensive for energy customers, all in the name of appeasing climate obsessives.

 Installing a heat pump will require one in three homes to have an electricity upgrade, a power company has said.

Heat pumps and electric car chargers will mean a big increase in a household’s electricity demand, with many older properties requiring upgrades that can cost thousands of pounds, though most companies are planning to start “socialising” the cost by spreading it out among bills, says the Telegraph.

Western Power Distribution (WPD), which manages the electricity network for the Midlands, South Wales and the South West, said providing power to heat homes was one of the “biggest challenges” of the heat pump rollout.

“We anticipate that this will lead to the need for service upgrades for around a third of all heat pump installations,” the company said in its business plan, published in December.

Earlier this month The Telegraph reported that some households were being charged up to £15,000 to upgrade to a “three-phase” supply, which is needed by households with particularly large electricity needs.

In most cases households will need a smaller upgrade, to allow a supply of 80 or 100 amps, which can cost hundreds of pounds.

The supply required depends on the size of the property, how many people are living there and what other electrical appliances are installed.

Some households also have “looped” supplies meaning their homes are connected to neighbouring properties. These can be the most difficult to fix, with permission often required from neighbouring homes to dig in gardens and driveways in order to “de-loop” the cables.
