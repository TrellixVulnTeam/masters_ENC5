America's largest death row, which is home to around 700 condemned prisoners, is to be dismantled and turned into a "positive, healing environment".

Gavin Newsom, the Democrat governor of California, said the decision was based on his belief that capital punishment is a deeply flawed system which "gets my blood boiling".

Mr Newsom said: "The prospect of your ending up on death row has more to do with your wealth and race than it does your guilt or innocence.

"We talk about justice, we preach justice, but as a nation, we don't practice it on death row."

California is one of 28 US states that have death rows, but it last carried out an execution in 2006.

Over the next two years the condemned prisoners will be moved out of the state's death row at San Quentin prison, about 20 miles north of San Francisco, to seven other jails.

The death row is a section of a larger jail at San Quentin and will be renovated into facilities for the remaining non-condemned prisoners.

A California prisons spokeswoman said: "We are starting the process of closing death row to repurpose and transform the current housing units into something innovative and anchored in rehabilitation."

In a referendum in 2016 the people of California supported the death penalty by 53 per cent to 46 per cent.
