Q. I’m lactose intolerant, but still enjoy milk in cereal and coffee. What is the best alternative, nondairy milk to drink?

A. The bottom line is that a variety of alternative drinks can provide similar nutrition to cow’s milk, so other than personal preference, it comes down to how you define “best.”

Cow’s milk is naturally high in protein, calcium and a variety of other important vitamins and minerals. Through fortification, it also offers vitamins A and D.

If the goal is to enjoy a product as similar to cow’s milk as possible, then lactose-free cow’s milk or soy milk may be your best bets. “A diagnosis of lactose intolerance actually doesn’t mean you have to fully avoid cow’s milk dairy products,” said Alicia Romano, a registered dietitian at the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at Tufts Medical Center, and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
