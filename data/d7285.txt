Summary: Carnosic acid, a compound found in the herb rosemary, can block the interaction with the COVID-19 SARS_CoV_2 spike protein and ACE2, the protein receptor the virus uses to gain access into cells. The compound appears to have anti-inflammatory effects and has previously been associated with a reduction in Alzheimer’s symptoms.

A team co-led by scientists at Scripps Research has found evidence that a compound contained in the medicinal and culinary herb rosemary could be a two-pronged weapon against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

The scientists, in experiments described in a paper published January 6, 2022 in the journal Antioxidants, found that the compound, carnosic acid, can block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 outer “spike” protein and the receptor protein, ACE2, which the virus uses to gain entry to cells.

The team also presented evidence, and reviewed evidence from prior studies, that carnosic acid has a separate effect in inhibiting a powerful inflammatory pathway—a pathway that is active in severe COVID-19 as well as in other diseases including Alzheimer’s. …
