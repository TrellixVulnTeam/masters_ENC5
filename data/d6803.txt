Germany could relax Covid-19 restrictions in the spring, the government’s justice minister has said. “I hope that we can phase out many protective measures in March”, Marco Buschmann told Rheinische Post newspaper.

However, the liberal politician said, a lack of new variants and a drop in infection rates was a prerequisite for such a step.

Mask-wearing is still mandatory on public transport, at schools and many indoor public spaces in Germany. Access to restaurants, cafes or bars is restricted to those who have been vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus and can show a recent negative test, or those with a booster shot. Nightclubs remain closed.

Virologist Christian Drosten, a leading coronavirus expert who advises the government, has warned of rushing towards an exit from restrictions. Germany had a disadvantage compared to countries like Denmark, Drosten said on his podcast for broadcaster NDR, as it has a relatively high percentage of older people who remain unvaccinated.

Germany has recorded 208,498 new Covid cases in the past 24 hours, a 50% jump on the 139,000 infections on Wednesday two weeks ago – taking the country’s total tally to over 10 million.
