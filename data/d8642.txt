THERE will be a familiar face in the middle to take charge of Kidderminster Harriers' fourth-round FA Cup clash with Premier League side West Ham at Aggborough on Saturday.

Top-flight official Jonathan Moss has the whistle for what most are saying is the tie of the round as Kiddy look to continue their FA Cup heroics this weekend. Marc Perry and Timothy Wood are his assistants and Leigh Doughty is the fourth official.

This will not be his first time refereeing Kidderminster in this competition, as he refereed Harriers' 0-0 draw with Peterborough in the third round of the FA Cup back in 2014, a tie they went on to win 3-2 in the replay. Having beaten Championship side Reading in the previous round, Russell Penn's charges welcome David Moyes' Hammers to Worcestershire in front of a packed out Aggborough. The game will also be watched by millions back at home as BBC One is showing the game live, with the studio now in place at the home of the Harriers.
