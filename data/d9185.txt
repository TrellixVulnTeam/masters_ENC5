Evidence that speaks for itself

A massive cosmic impact (or disintegration) around 13,000 years ago may have caused the extinction of numerous animals on Earth, but also a catastrophic reset in developing ancient civilizations of the time.Some 13,000 years ago, a massive comet fragmented and impacted Earth, changing a planet in more ways than one. The catastrophic collision was powerful. It is likely to have triggered a mass extinction on the planet, resetting along the way a number of ancient cultures that may have already been relatively well-developed at the time.Scientists have found that in the span of just a few years, the average temperate on Earth dropped abruptly,in some regions of the planet's Northern Hemisphere. It was an extreme change, and scientists have found evidence thatthanks to layers of ice found in Greenland.This abrupt change in Earth's climate is defined by the so-called Younger Dryas theory, which marked the start of an abrupt decline in ice-age megafauna, leading to the extinction of around 35 different genera of animals During the Younger Dryas , not only animals went extinct. It is believed that this period alsoThe catastrophic collision 12,800 years ago is now seen and widely accepted as leaving a profound imprint in many developing cultures, starting a kind of global reset.Although many authors and scientists have theorized that such an event took place around 13,000 years ago, the evidence was scarce, albeit there in central North America and the sudden, extensive blast of freshwater they discharged into the North Atlantic.The Younger Dryas event comes from a wildflower called Dryas octopetala, which can tolerate icy conditions, which became common in many parts of Europe around 12,800 years ago.Cumulative evidence points towards the sky. The so-called impact hypothesis states that a comet or asteroid fragment impacted our planet around 13,000 years ago, causing catastrophic climate changes. Not only did this collision completely disrupt the glacial ice sheets, but it also caused the ocean's current to come to a halt.It is also believed thatdue to an extensive amount of smoke. Scientists have calculated that as much as ten percent of global forests and grasslands most likely burned following the extraterrestrial impact. The scientific study of ocean, lake, terrestrial, and ice core records shows huge peaks in particles that are directly associated with burning: charcoal and soot. The most curious thing is, the evidence perfectly fits into the time of the Younger Dryas. This data is something you would naturally find as the result of catastrophic wildfires after a massive cosmic collision, say, scientists.Furthermore, over the years, scientific analysis of different parts of the world has revealedHowever, and although the evidence supports a cosmic impact scenario, other studies have suggested that these materials - microspherules and nanodiamonds - can be formed by natural processes not involving a comet impact.But a new study published in Scientific Reports , archaeologist Christopher Moore and 16 colleagues have discovered evidence of a comic impact after studyingProfessor Christopher Moore is also the man behind previous studies that have found spikes and elevated platinum levels in different archeological sites, including one in Chile , which happens to be the first direct evidence in the Southern Hemisphere.In other words,In addition to the above,A massive crater revealed unusually high amounts of platinum and iridium in outwash sediments. Although said crater has not been dated yet, scientists see it as a smoking gun that can help confirm the cosmic impact scenario. Data gathered in South America and other parts of the world suggest the cosmic even may have actually included numerous impacts and airbursts that happened on a global scale.The data obtained from White Pond in South Carolina adds to the wealth of evidence supporting a cosmic impact. Researchers used a core barrel and extracted sediment samples from beneath the bond. These samples were then dated to the start of the Younger Dryas. The scientists discovered a large platinum anomaly within the core samples, which is consistent with findings from other sites.In addition to the platinum anomaly within the sediments, theassociated with the dung of large herbivores precisely at the start of the Younger Dryas period, a telltale sign of a decline in ice-age mini fauna traced back at the time of impact.Moore said:Curiously, one of the most iconic ancient sites on Earth,may offer evidence of the cosmic impact, as witnessed by people around 13,000 years ago.Göbekli Tepe is widely regarded asIt was there where an unknown culture erected more than 200 stone pillars in around 20 circles. Each of the pillars has a height of around six meters, weighing up to ten tons.Using computer simulations of the Solar System around that time, researchers in 2017 found that the carvings at Göbekli Tepe represent a potential comet impact - curiously just around the same time a mini ice age caused the world, and civilization as we know it, to change forever.Scientists from the University of Edinburgh in the UK s uggest that various carvings found at Göbekli Tepe show how a comet strike may have been responsible for Earth's history-changing period.Speaking to the Telegraph in 2017, Sarah Knapton explained:Martin Sweatman, from the University of Edinburgh's School of Engineering, revealed in an interview with the Press Association The pillars on which the catastrophic cosmic events are believed to have been etched is referred to as theAmong the numerous animal symbols, the stone also depicts a headless man, which scientists believe represents an extensive loss of life, possibly due to the cosmic impact.
