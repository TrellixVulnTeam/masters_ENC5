Martinez said the district is encouraging staff members to get their booster shots, but could not say if a deadline is in place for that vaccination. CPS initially said staff members would be “ineligible to work” this school year if they were not fully vaccinated or had not received an exemption for medical or religious reasons. The district later backed off of this requirement and allowed unvaccinated staff members to work if they were tested for COVID-19 at least once a week.
