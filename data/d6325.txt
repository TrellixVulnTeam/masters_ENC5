“New Yorkers deserve a transparent and fair redistricting process, and it is shameful that the Legislature has denied them this,” said Laura Ladd Bierman, executive director of the League of Women Voters of NYS. “Partisan gerrymandering is banned under the state constitutional amendment passed in 2014, yet the maps released on the 31st and the 1st reflect a Legislature that appears to care more about favoring partisan interests than it does for fair maps.”
