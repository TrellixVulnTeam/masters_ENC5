Michigan gubernatorial candidate Garrett Soldano (R) said in a radio interview that we must “inspire women” who have been raped to understand how heroic they are in giving birth and see that “God put them in this moment.”

He added: “And they don’t know, that little baby inside them may be the next president, may be the next person who changes humanity.”
