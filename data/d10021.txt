Two British women who had never rowed before have broken the world record for the fastest female pair to cross the Atlantic Ocean, despite a late collision with another boat that almost scuppered their chances of success.

Jessica Oliver and Charlotte Harris rowed 3,000 miles to victory in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge ahead of 35 other teams from all over the world.

The friends, who met at Cardiff University 10 years ago, managed to overcome a near-disastrous collision with a large sailing boat in the dead of night when they were just 35 miles from the finish line.

The pair managed to manually steer away from the boat at the last minute, but not before it “came up on a wave and crashed down into our stern”, according to Ms Oliver.
