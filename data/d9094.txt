Agence France-Presse is reporting that, according to Downing Street, UK, and Russian leaders have agreed on a need for ‘peaceful resolution’ over Ukraine. That seems like they’ve made some significant move there and we’ll have to wait for more to come out, but it certainly sounds positive.

That would be significant, given more than 100,000 Russian troops perched on the border with Ukraine.

AFP is reporting that France’s President Emmanuel Macron could go to Russia for further discussions.

In a scoop at Axios, Israel is also reporting they don’t think this is going to escalate to war. According to Barak Ravid, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told him, “At the moment, the [Israeli] assessment is that we don’t see a violent confrontation soon. I also don’t think a world war is about to start there.”

Meanwhile, that doesn’t seem completely in sync with the actions of the United States. Joe Biden has just approved sending nearly 3,000 extra troops to Poland and Romania to reinforce Eastern European NATO allies.

Ukraine is saying only the withdrawal of troops can de-escalate the tension.
