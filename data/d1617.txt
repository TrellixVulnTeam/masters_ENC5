President Trump released a statement on the upcoming movie by Dinesh D’Souza with Catherine Engelbrecht on the rampant election fraud of the 2020 election. Catherine and her True the Vote organization were able to track hundreds of ballot traffickers who were paid to drop THOUSANDS of illegal ballots in hundreds of ballot boxes in battleground states.

The investigation finally proves what we all knew from the beginning. The 2020 election was stolen and Joe Biden is an illegitimate president.

“Highly respected Dinesh D’Souza, working together with Catherine Engelbrecht of True the Vote, just released a trailer to their new movie, “2,000 Mules,” that shows the world exactly how the 2020 Presidential Election was Rigged and Stolen. The movie exposes the lies of the Democrats, RINOs, and Fake News who say it was the “most secure election in history.” It was, perhaps, the least secure in history. The ballot box was stuffed, and stuffed like never before-and it’s all on video. Ballots were trafficked and sold in a massive operation in each Swing State. The evidence is so damning, what will the cowards who sat and did nothing about the stolen election say now? The way our votes were taken away is a disgrace to our Nation. It must be fixed.”
