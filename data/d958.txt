LOS ANGELES — A former lecturer at UCLA appeared to post a troubling video and a manifesto that referenced race and a mass shooting– prompting the university’s philosophy department to cancel in-person classes on Tuesday, according to a report.

The Los Angeles Times reported that the former postdoctoral fellow and lecturer is accused of sending an 800-page manifesto with threats toward people at the school. The paper, which said it reviewed a portion of the email to the philosophy department, reported that the former lecturer is accused of referencing race and wrote, “da war is comin. forward dis [explitive] to our tha goldhead caucasoid princess.”

The school did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. Its official Twitter account said the school’s police department is “aware of a concerning email and posting sent to some members of the UCLA community today and actively engaging with out-of-state law enforcement and federal agencies.”

The paper named the former lecturer, but Fox News was unable to independently verify the identity. The report said there was a video posted on YouTube Sunday night titled, “UCLA PHILOSOPHY (MASS SHOOTING).”

The clip contained footage from the 2017 shooting in Las Vegas and a movie that the paper said was “loosely based on the Columbine High School mass shooting.”

Some apparent students took to social media to express their dismay that the entire school did not cancel classes at its Westwood campus.
