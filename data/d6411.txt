Punchbowl News: “The Senate is beginning to grapple with a new reality. With Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) in the hospital after a stroke, Democrats don’t have a functioning majority. They will be unable to move anything besides non-controversial bills and nominations. As we all know, there are very few of those these days.”

“The longer Luján is out, the more problematic his absence becomes. A lengthy recovery could impact President Joe Biden’s ability to confirm a new Supreme Court nominee. If Luján is sidelined for a long period of time, Biden may have to rethink who he nominates to the Supreme Court.”
