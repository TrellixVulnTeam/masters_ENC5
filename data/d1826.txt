• Liz Truss to miss Kyiv trip after testing positive for Covid-19
• PM to land in Kyiv at 3.15pm GMT
• PM's call with Putin delayed as Macron gets in first
• ​US is warmongering, says China in fiery skirmish at UN
• Russia could be stopped through sanctions, says former head of MI6

Vladimir Putin, who hasn't spoken about the ongoing tensions in weeks, is likely to break his silence with a press conference this afternoon.

His spokesman would not say when Mr Putin will formulate a written response to the US reaction to Russia's security demands in Ukraine - but said the Russian president will field questions after his meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban this afternoon.

It comes as Boris Johnson departed for Kyiv to hold a press conference with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, in a show of support for the country against Russian aggression.

The visit is going ahead after a phone call with Vladimir Putin that was delayed after the Prime Minister was unable to talk due to his own 'partygate' grilling meant the Russian president discussed the Ukraine crisis with Emmanuel Macron.

A Downing Street source confirmed that the phone call that was due to take place on Monday afternoon between the Prime Minister and Mr Putin had been “postponed”, but was unable to confirm when it would be rescheduled.
