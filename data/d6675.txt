A HAMPSHIRE shopping centre is on the hunt for three new charity partners for its Giving Box.

The giant Giving Box, located in Market Square at Whiteley shopping centre is aimed at raising funds for charities that do work in the community.

Shoppers are encouraged to donate £1, £3 or £5 via contactless payments and since it was installed in December 2020, the box has raised "generous donations" for three charities.

But now the centre is looking for more charities and groups to support and is inviting organisations to apply to be one of its partners.

Mia Gordon, centre director at Whiteley, said: “We’re so proud of how our community has come together to support our current charity partners and we hope that all of the donations have helped them continue the vital work they do in our local community.

“The impact of the pandemic is still being felt by so many across the country, especially charities whose fundraising efforts may have been impacted.

"We’re encouraging all charities and community groups who are interested in being one of our new Giving Box partners to get in touch and look forward to working with new partners and giving back for the amazing work that they do.”
