"I was exposed in 12th grade and it ruined me for a bit. I was a virgin and he was the only guy I sent them to. I lost all trust in men. I would hear people talking about me behind my back and get a weird comment or two from guys I didn’t even know. I didn’t go to prom or take senior pictures. I don’t interact with my extended family anymore because a lot of them went to the same school as me. It still continues to affect me to this day. I don’t have any social media because I’m terrified of someone leaking them again. My dream is to become a YouTuber/musician but I can’t even do that, and that makes me incredibly sad. I’m tearing up right now as I type this. Maybe someday I’ll be able to live fear-free, but for now I’ll just stay in my little bubble."
