GEORGINA RODRIGUEZ is starring in her own Netflix show: I Am Georgina.

The hit doc is showing behind-the-scenes footage of Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina's family life, though many are wondering about the family from her side.

Georgina Rodriguez's father was Argentinian and her mother is Spanish.

Her father Jorge Rodriguez was a cocaine and cannabis kingpin who spent ten years in jail.

Jorge served time in Spain for two offences.

He was sentenced to 11 years in jail in 2003 for masterminding a failed plot to smuggle more than £100,000 worth of 83 per cent pure cocaine from Spain to France.

He was freed on licence in 2008 but was soon back inside for smuggling £1million of cannabis resin from Morocco to Spain with accomplices. He got a two-year term and was freed in 2013.

Jorge died at 70 in 2019. He is said to have suffered from complications related to a stroke he had two-and-a-half years before.

Her mother is Ana Maria Hernandez, who reportedly now resides in Italy.

Georgina Rodriguez was born in Argentina and grew up in Jaca, a city in north eastern Spain.

Georgina learned dance before changing careers to modelling after studying English in London, and once worked as an au pair in Bristol.

The 28-year-old was first spotted on a string of dates with then-Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo towards the end of 2016.

Before meeting Ronaldo, Georgina worked at a Gucci store in the Spanish capital of Madrid.

Georgina gave birth to baby daughter Alana Martina on November 12, 2017, with Ronaldo posting a picture on Instagram, writing: "Alana Martina is just born! Both Geo and Alana are doing great! We are all very happy!'"

And just over two years later, the pair were forced to deny rumours that they had got hitched in a low-key ceremony in Morocco.

On October 28, Ronaldo and Georgina confirmed they will be welcoming twins in 2022.
