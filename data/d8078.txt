At his latest press conference, Mitch McConnell ignored the question "how many Black women work in your office?" several times.

Reporter Pablo Manríquez finally pulled off his mask and shouted the question.

“I haven’t checked, we don’t have a racial quota in my office.”

Oh come ON, Mitch. You aren't really saying you "don't see color" are you?

You do too have a racial quota of Republican white guys who are willing to work for Team Evil for money, advancement, and power.
