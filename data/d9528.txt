Columbia, S.C. – January 25, 2022 – SC Safe Elections Group, a non-partisan volunteer group comprised of approximately 75 citizens from across eight South Carolina counties will present findings of its canvass of South Carolina voter rolls and the 2020 General Election on February 5, 2022 from 1:00 – 5:00 p.m. EST in the Club Lounge at Segra Park in Columbia, S.C. Presenters will share results that revealed widespread inaccuracies with voter rolls and potentially ineligible votes.

“Even though South Carolina is a red state and went for Donald Trump in the 2020 election, our canvassing efforts found bombshell evidence of phantom voters, deceased voters, ineligible voters, lost votes, cross-state votes and many other anomalies with the 2020 election,” said Laura Scharr, leader of the South Carolina voter integrity effort. “Our goal with this event is to inform the public and our lawmakers of the issues we uncovered and to request specific steps that will improve the accuracy of our elections.”

The public will be able to view the presentation through a live feed at: https://scsafeelections.org. A summary report of the findings of the audit can also be found at this website.
