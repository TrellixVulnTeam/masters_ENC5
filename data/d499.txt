DENVER (AP) — Police are investigating after human remains were found in two large suitcases near a trail in southwest Denver.

Lt. Matt Clark with the Denver Police Department's Major Crimes Division said during a news conference Wednesday that city workers were clearing snow from the sidewalks in a residential area near Sanderson Gulch on Tuesday morning when they found the suitcases abandoned off the side of the road. The workers examined the luggage and called police.

The Denver coroner's office, which determined the unidentified remains belonged to one person, has not released a cause or manner of death.

Clark said the death is being investigated as a homicide, but he did not have any information about possible suspects. He described the victim as a “recently deceased” white man and declined to comment about the state of the remains.

Clark added that investigators are reviewing footage from residential security cameras to see if they captured anything suspicious and are trying to determine if the remains match any missing person reports.

“At this point, I don’t have anybody to connect directly to this incident yet,” he said. “The investigators worked throughout the day on it.”

No other information has been released.
