Mr Raab was speaking a day after an interim report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray revealed the Metropolitan Police were now looking into 12 parties which may have breached Covid lockdown rules including four which may have directly involved Mr Johnson.

Following the report, which found there was a failure of leadership at Downing Street, Mr Johnson vowed to overhaul his No10 operation in an effort to save his premiership.

He has also committed to publishing the Gray report in full after the Met has completed its investigation after coming under pressure from Conservative MPs.

Following a meeting with Tory MPs after an emotionally charged session in the House of Commons yesterday, Mr Johnson appears to have been given more time to convince his critics he can restore his authority.

Mr Raab told Times Radio on Tuesday: “On the specific issues Sue Gray cited he has addressed all of those questions in a fulsome way. And frankly at the political level my experience was in the chamber but also at the meeting of Conservative MPs, overwhelmingly MPs backing him, wanting to see us get on with the job.”

Elsewhere, Mr Raab confirmed the Prime Minister and his wife have not yet been interviewed by police about the gathering in the No10 flat, which has been described as an Abba themed “winner takes it all” party to mark Dominic Cummings leaving his post as the PM’s Chief Advisor.
