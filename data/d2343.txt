On MSNBC’s 11th Hour, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said she would support a primary challenge to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), citing the senator’s opposition to Biden’s Far Left agenda.

In an interview with globalist leftwing MSNBC, AOC responded to host’s question saying “As you mentioned that race is in 2024 and that means Kyrsten Sinema is about four years into her six-year term. I don’t believe she is really given a compelling case as to why she should be re-nominated as the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in Arizona.”

When asked directly about a far left primary challenger Ruben Gallego, AOC replied “If it came down to someone like Ruben Gallego and Kyrsten Sinema, I think that would be the easiest decision I would ever have to make.” Whatever will advance the leftist anti American agenda is good to AOC.

Ocasio-Cortez then pretended to sound like a populist despite constantly doing corporatists and globalist bidding. “Now is not a moment to stick up for corporations but rather stand up for working people. And we need someone who has more allegiance to the actual people of this country than special interests.” This is ironic coming from one of the most left wing members of congress who continually puts the interests of foreign nationals ahead of Americans.

In the same breath she also mouthed typical leftist talking points “This is a state that deserves to be represented by a strong Democrat”. By strong Democrat one can ask does she mean an open borders America Last limousine liberal?
