Trustees for the City University of New York voted Monday to end a policy under which the 260,000-student public system withheld transcripts and refused to verify enrollment for students who owed tuition and fee balances.

The system had already suspended its transcript withholding policy in August. But Monday's vote makes the change permanent.

The move comes a week after CUNY's sister system, the State University of New York,

academic transcripts from students with outstanding debt. The two systems made the changes after Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed ending transcript withholding during a State of the State Address earlier this year. Hochul, a Democrat, is also proposing legislation to prevent transcript withholding at all higher ed institutions in New York.
