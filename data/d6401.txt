Gallup: “Americans’ satisfaction with a variety of aspects of U.S. society and the state of policy in key issue areas remains subdued in 2022 after falling in 2021. In fact, in only one area — acceptance of gays and lesbians — are more Americans satisfied now than were in 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic.”

“Over the past year, there have been further meaningful declines in 10 areas, most notably in satisfaction with energy policy, the nation’s military strength, the state of the economy, and abortion policy.”

Harry Enten: “What this data indicates is that, nearly two years into the pandemic in the United States, there has not been any real recovery in how Americans believe things are going.”
