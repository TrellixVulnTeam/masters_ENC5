ABANDONED vehicles in Fareham could be removed with the help of local residents.

Fareham Borough Council is cracking down on the ‘growing issue’ of vehicles being left disused across the borough.

Executive Member for Health and Public Protection, Cllr Trevor Cartwright, said: "Abandoned vehicles are a growing issue in the Borough and I encourage residents to report any vehicle which they suspect has been abandoned.

"Part of this problem is related to unscrupulous business owners parking unregistered or SORN vehicles on the highway, which cannot be tolerated.

"Not only are our roads not appropriate for illegal car storage, but these vehicles make travelling and parking more difficult for residents and car owners who do tax, insure and MOT their vehicles."

A vehicle could be classed as abandoned if it’s left on land without consent from the landowner or on parts of a highway.

The council has licensing and regulatory powers officers can use to remove abandoned vehicles but they need help from residents to identify them.

Once a complaint is received the council will visit the vehicle and issue a statutory notice if appropriate.

The council can attempt to trace the owner and possibly charge them for any fees relating to removing the vehicle.

Depending on the notice served on the vehicle and the progress of tracing the owner, the vehicle can be removed to be either stored or scrapped depending on its condition.

If you suspect a vehicle to be abandoned you can check its status on the DVLA website.

You can report abandoned vehicles to the council by filling in a form and uploading an image to the council’s website.
