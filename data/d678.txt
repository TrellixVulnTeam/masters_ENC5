Shana added, "A part of my coaching program is the transformation of limiting beliefs. I love to tell my ladies that if they call themselves dirty, then I believe them, but it is not because of the herpes — I have herpes and I am far from dirty. I require they say it out loud, so they can hear how they talk to themselves — we work to change their self-talk. Next, I have them write it down and get rid of it — say out loud, I am not dirty, I am a sexually responsible adult who knows my status and is able to have healthy sexual communication. The transformation of limiting beliefs becomes my clients' new affirmation list that I hold them accountable to recite to themselves daily. It makes me so sad that the majority of women within the herpes community feel dirty and ashamed."
