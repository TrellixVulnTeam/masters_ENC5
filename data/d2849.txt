In charge of a nation so strong at home in a competitive sense, his side have a wonderful chance of making into the Africa Cup of Nations final on their own turf.

While Egypt do offer daunting opposition, they are not without their own problems despite their attacking talent and have looked beatable at times, albeit Cameroon haven’t always convinced themselves amid some rather favourable fixtures.

The star man, of course, has been top scorer Vincent Aboubakar but Karl Toko Ekambi has been equally as impressive and it’s hard to see much changing at all for Thursday’s semi-final.
