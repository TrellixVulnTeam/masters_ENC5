February 1 marks the beginning of a new Lunar Year. According to the Chinese zodiac, we’ll be entering the Year of the Tiger and many fashion brands are celebrating with special tiger-themed capsule collections.

Many labels including Louis Vuitton, Aspinal and Kenzo have used this year’s zodiac sign in their designs, while others are paying tribute with the colour red, which symbolises good luck and good fortune in Chinese culture.
