In the two years that the New York-based curator Cecilia Alemani had to organize the 59th edition of the Venice Biennale — during which the pandemic forced a one-year delay and 400 studio visits had to happen on Zoom — the world changed around her.

People grappled with large existential questions about the purpose of life, problems of inequity and the health of the planet. There were moments of dystopian doom and hopeful reinvention.

These issues informed Alemani’s iteration of the Biennale — the world’s longest-running major survey of contemporary art — the details of which were revealed on Wednesday.

There is a majority of female and gender-nonconforming artists, a choice that Alemani, in her official announcement, said reflects “a deliberate rethinking of man’s centrality in the history of art and contemporary culture.”
