At least 10 people were injured and 10 people were missing on Wednesday after a landslide in a village about 30 miles northeast of Oslo that Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway said was one of the worst in the country’s history.

About 1,000 people were evacuated from the village of Ask, and at least five were hospitalized, one with severe injuries, the police said. Rescuers were limited in how close they could get to the scene because the ground was still moving Wednesday night.

The landslide swallowed at least seven homes, and “extensive rescue work is underway on site,” the police said in a statement. Helicopters and drones were being used to search the area, and it remained possible that some of the evacuated homes near the edge of the landslide could still fall in.

The police said that 10 people were unaccounted for as of Wednesday night and that it seemed likely that some of them had been in the area devastated by the landslide. The cause of the landslide was not immediately clear.
