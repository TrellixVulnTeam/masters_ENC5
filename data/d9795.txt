People have died in record numbers from drug overdoses across the United States as the coronavirus has raged, according to preliminary Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Health experts believe the increase in fatal overdoses reflects a convergence of an array of issues, including a deepening of mental health challenges for some people and the widening availability of dangerous street drugs.

One such drug, the synthetic opioid fentanyl, can be several dozen times more powerful than opioids derived from natural sources. The drug, which can be prescribed legally to treat pain, is cheap to make and has spread underground as a potent heroin alternative.

There has been a pronounced jump in overdose deaths in New York City, with more than 2,300 in the 12-month period that ended last March, according to the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for the City of New York; about six people died of overdoses each day in recent months, the office has said. The vast majority of those deaths involved fentanyl, heroin or some combination of the two, according to the office.

Before his death, Mr. Williams had also openly discussed his personal fight to overcome drug addiction.

“The Wire,” which aired on HBO over five seasons in the 2000s, explored the underworld of crime and drugs in Baltimore and how it intersected with institutions like City Hall, the police and schools. The series is widely viewed by critics as among the best in TV history, and Mr. Williams’s character — a vicious killer with a surprising soft side and a strict code of honor — was among the most popular with viewers.

The investigation into Mr. Williams’s death relied on sustained detective work, license-plate readers and surveillance video, the complaint makes clear.

The police, responding to a report of an unresponsive man at Mr. Williams’s apartment on Sept. 6, found him dead, with what were later determined to be narcotics and related paraphernalia on a table, the complaint says.
