There seems no end to the eternal whining of Senator Susan “concerned” Collins. Collins has not shut her mouth since Justice Breyer’s resignation. It is getting to the point where it’s just embarrassing for her — not that she seems to notice.

Appearing on ABC’s “The Week,” the brow-furrowed Collins rebuked President Biden for being “clumsy” in his handling of the nomination. In fact, many people appear to be saying that. And that includes some in the media.

Collins is as easy to read as the worst poker player. Her “tells” are all over the place. She clearly is frantically seeking a reason to vote against whomever Biden nominates. Collins is at her rotten core, a Republican. She isn’t any different than Mitch McConnell.

Think about it. The woman is a perpetual whiner with a perpetual scowl. And she is NOT — contrary to her own deluded reality — an independent voice. She is a sheep, pure and simple. But it isn’t just her.

The media is having a field fay. Suddenly, issues that never came up during any of Trump’s nomination processes are all of a sudden deeply concerning.

The pundits seem to be DROOLING over their hope that something prevents Biden from fulfilling his promise. (That won’t happen.) Listen to their voices next time you watch. Listen to the need — the desperate hope that Democrats fail at this, and then they have a brand new story.

The fact is we won’t. We don’t need Collins, although she may wind up voting with us anyway. But her complaining — as well as that of the media — is getting really boring. Next time you turn on the TV and see a whining and concerned Collins, feel free to exercise your right to change the channel.
