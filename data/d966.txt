For some perspective on how bad Biden’s numbers are for the fall, in 2010 Obama’s approval rating was down in the mid-40s . In those midterms Democrats lost 63 seats in the House and […]

The McLaughlin study also showed that Joe Biden’s approval rating has crumbled to 41 percent, which is high compared to Quinippiac’s 33 percent. NBC poll numbers were so bad that noted corporate propagandist and regime cheerleader, Chuck Todd, who masquerades as a journalist for that network, admitted that Biden’s numbers put Democrats in the “ shellacking ” range for the midterms. Todd noted that the overwhelming majority of voters think Biden is “no longer seen as competent and effective.” Of course, it’s been many decades since anyone in their right mind saw Biden as anything resembling competent and effective. But it is noteworthy that others are catching on.

According to a recent McLaughlin and Associates study, 65 percent of likely voters believe that the United States is on the wrong track. That’s hardly surprising considering the multitude of poor decisions the fascists in charge have made since taking power.

If you’re a Democrat, things are going very, very badly for you. And it’s not going to get better.

One Sick Day Proves We Need More Voices in Truthful Media

On October 19, I was sick. It crossed my mind that I had finally gotten the ‘rona, but my wife’s cream of chicken soup and a few extra hours of sleep into mid-afternoon had be back up and running after a sleepless night before.

When I finally stumbled over to my computer in the evening, I was met with a deluge of concern from readers. They asked what had happened as only one article had been posted that day. Generally, we post between 10-20 daily between all of the sites, not included curated and aggregated content. Seeing that we’d only posted my super-early morning article before taking the rest of the day off had readers assuming the worst.

We have a wonderful and talented group of writers who volunteer their time for the sites and their readers. Sharing their amazing perspectives has always been a blessing to us because we cannot afford to hire anyone at this time. But having great writers is meaningless if we don’t have great editors, or at least one additional. My wife helps me read and edit stories from time to time, but I’m a one-man show when it comes to getting the stories posted.

Whenever I highlight our desperate need for donations, I note that we do not receive money from Google ads even though most in conservative media are beholden. I often ambiguously note that the money donated will help us grow. Today, I’m highlighting a specific need. We must get an editor to help take some of the load and to expand on our mission of spreading the truth to the world. One sick day proved that.

The great news is that there is no shortage of people who CAN help. I am emailed variations of resumes every week by people who are much smarter than I am. As much as I’d love to hire some of them, we simply cannot. That takes money and as blessed as we’ve been to receive donations and collect ad money (though not from Google or Facebook), we have still fallen short.

Those who have the means, PLEASE consider donating. We have the standard Giving Fuel option and people can donate through PayPal. We are also diving into what we believe is extremely disruptive technology at LetsGo.finance, the world’s first major donation portal for crypto. I’ll be talking a lot more about them in the near future. Those who prefer Bitcoin can send to my address here: 3A1ELVhGgrwrypwTJhPwnaTVGmuqyQrMB8

We can get the voices out there and we’re willing to shine a spotlight on new talent. We just need the resources to make it happen. If you can help, we would be extremely grateful.

Thank you and God bless!
