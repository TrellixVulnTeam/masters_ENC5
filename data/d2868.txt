During a diplomatic mission to Kyiv, the Prime Minister said it is vital the Kremlin “steps back” from what would be a “military disaster” for both Russia and the world.

But Mr Johnson was also forced to fend off questions about the scandal hanging over his leadership surrounding alleged lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street.

At a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky the Prime Minister said: “We have done all this and prepared all this not as a show of hostility towards Russia, but as a demonstration that we will always stand up for freedom and democracy and Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of aggression.”

He added: “It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy, and I believe that is still possible, we are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are, but we have the sanctions ready, we’re providing military support, and we will also intensify our economic cooperation.”
