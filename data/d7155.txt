CHELSEA are interested in signing Real Madrid star Eder Militao, according to reports.

Thomas Tuchel has been determined to land a centre-back since last summer and now has his eye on a new target.

But Militao has been on Chelsea's radar since 2019, when he moved to Real instead of Stamford Bridge.

Now The Blues could make another move for the 24-year-old as a replacement for the potential departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen, reports Spanish outlet AS.

The defensive pair are out of contract at the end of the season and have been linked with moves away.

Borussia Dortmund have their eye on Christensen while Rudiger is wanted by Juventus and Bayern Munich.

And having previously failed to sign Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde, Chelsea will now focus on Militao.

But they could face similar difficulty in attempting to sign the Brazilian since he reportedly wants to stay at Los Blancos.

He is also a crucial part of Carlo Ancelotti's plans having played the most minutes of any outfield player at Real this season - and just six minutes less than goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Militao is also the most expensive defender in Real's history and with a contract until 2025 the Spanish giants would be able to demand a considerable fee to let him go.

That means Chelsea might have to settle for other targets with Bayern Munich ace Niklas Sule often linked with a move to The Blues.

Tuchel will likely make defensive reinforcements a top priority in the summer if Rudiger and Christensen leave.

Captain Cesar Azpilicueta has also entered the final months of his contract and looks set to join Barcelona on a free in the summer.
