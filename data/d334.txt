The COVID-19 outbreaks at Colorado’s two In-N-Out Burger restaurants have grown over the last week, with the state now reporting 122 employees have tested positive for the virus between the chain’s Aurora and Colorado Springs locations.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s outbreak database, updated publicly every Wednesday, now shows 80 confirmed staff cases at the Colorado Springs restaurant and 42 confirmed cases among employees at the Aurora location.

Last week, the two restaurants tallied 80 confirmed and 25 suspected staff cases between them. The state’s outbreak database does not list any customer cases tied to either In-N-Out location.

The two restaurants — the chain’s first in Colorado — opened to much fanfare Nov. 20, with hours-long drive-thru lines. They remain open, but since both are in counties under Colorado’s Level Red restrictions, they’re prohibited from offering indoor dining.

The outbreak at the Colorado Springs and Aurora locations began Dec. 6 and Dec. 17, respectively.

When news of the In-N-Out outbreaks first was reported last week, corporate spokesman Denny Warnick said all employees who tested positive for COVID-19 and those who had close contact with them “have been excluded from the workplace.”

“We continue to work closely with our public health agencies and have confirmed the appropriate steps to help protect our communities,” he said. “These steps include: limiting staff to the minimum number necessary to serve our customers, using staff ‘cohorts’ to limit possible exposure, and limiting dining room access to takeout orders only while ensuring appropriate physical distancing.”
