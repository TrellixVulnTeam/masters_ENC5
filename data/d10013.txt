Finding the right foundation is rather like investing in the perfect pair of jeans, once you find your perfect fit, it's yours for life.

However, when it comes to base you should consider reevaluating yours once a season as technologies advance as fast as an I-phone. These days it's not just a matter of shade, cosmetic companies are continuously working on nuances in colour, undertone, coverage (sheer, medium, full) and finish (glowy, matte, semi-matte).

Indeed, some of the best products address specific skin concerns such as redness and open pores. Of course, freckles, wrinkles, and all matter of imperfections are now celebrated, thank goodness, as real skin has a natural radiance that cannot be replicated by man-made pigments. The trick here is to opt for foundations that have added skincare benefits to improve the health of one's skin, rather than covering it up - that's what concealer is for, in small targeted areas such as under eyes, nose and chin.

As women over 40 are becoming increasingly valued by cosmetic brands that formally targeted millennials, we're pleased to announce that make-up, and particularly base, is caring for our complexions more than ever. Note: that doesn't discount the art of application, which when done right (or wrong) can make all the difference.

At a demonstration of Estée Lauder’s tinted moisturiser (£36) in 2020, Parisian make-up artist Violette applied the product to the model’s skin in moderate strokes, omitting her nose and cheeks as both have a natural flush that, she insists, if covered-up will dampen a healthy glow.
