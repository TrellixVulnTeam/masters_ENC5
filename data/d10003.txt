Pret a Manger has increased the cost of its monthly coffee subscription by almost five times the rate of inflation, sparking outrage among its customers.

The ubiquitous sandwich shop chain, popular with office workers, said it was increasing the cost of the subscription scheme to £25 a month, up from £20 – a 25pc rise.

Pret, which has more than 400 coffee shops around the country, launched the subscription during the pandemic to lure in new customers and retain old ones.

But it has decided to raise prices to cover the cost of upcoming tax increases, pay rises for staff and inflation, which hit 5.4pc in December – its highest for 30 years.

In a letter to customers the shop said: “Since we launched the subscription, prices for ingredients such as coffee beans and milk have gone up… and we have chosen to invest in our amazing Pret team who have carried us through the pandemic."
