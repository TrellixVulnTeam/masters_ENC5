t may come as a shock, but tier announcements, lockdowns and Downing Street press briefings are not the only things to have happened this year.

Yes, coronavirus has ruled 2020, casting its shadow over every corner of the Earth, but the past 12 months have been about more than just Covid-19.

With the help of the world's best photographers, the Standard has captured key events including wildfires, heated Black Lives Matter protests and the election of a new US president.

The year began with a devastating bang, as the eruption of the Philippines' Taal volcano forced thousands to flee their homes.

The month ended with fireworks of a very different kind when, on January 31, the UK officially left the EU.

The ensuing months saw streets deserted, or filled with roaming sheep – in the case of Welsh town Llanduduno – with Britons stepping out only as far as their doorsteps to clap for carers and key workers.

Summer heat waves sent wildfires raging across Australia and California, while the death of George Floyd sparked a global movement, as millions marched against police brutality and cried for racial justice.

June and July brought some sunnier days, too, as the season of Captain Tom Moore culminated in a knighthood from the Queen.

In August, seismic shockwaves rippled through Beirut, as a warehouse blast in Lebanon’s capital left more than 200 dead, while in Thailand, pro-democracy protests continued to rock Bangkok.

November was also the month of the US election, which saw a furious Donald Trump begin his ongoing and unsubstantiated claims of “voter fraud” as his rival Joe Biden swept to victory.

Just a few weeks later, Mr Biden, 78, received the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, after a 90-year-old grandmother from Coventry made history by becoming the world’s first recipient of the newly-approved jab.

Now, after families were forced by strict Covid restrictions to spend Christmas apart, it is time to look ahead to the promise and potential of 2021.

Following the most challenging 12 months many of us have ever faced, a lot rests on these three words: “Happy New Year”.
