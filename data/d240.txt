In the Georgia Senate runoff races, Democrat Jon Ossoff is running against Republican David Perdue, while Democrat Raphael Warnock is running against Republican Kelly Loeffler.

Fox News stuck a microphone in Jon Ossoff’s face today, so he used it as an opportunity to speak to the Fox audience. When the Fox reporter asked Ossoff about a phony scandal that Loeffler made up about Warnock, Ossoff fired back with “Kelly Loeffler has been campaigning with Klansman.”
