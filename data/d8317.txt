A former player at Blackburn, Macclesfield and Bangor City, Hitchen joined Spurs as their chief scout in February 2017 before his promotion in 2020 but saw Fabio Paratici appointed as Managing Director in June 2021 as the club looked to go in a different direction.

Paraticiâ€™s arrival has seen the club first appoint Nuno Espirito Santo and then Antonio Conte as manager while also signing Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from former club Juventus,

Hitchen oversaw a period in which Spurs broke their relatively long-standing transfer record on Tanguy Ndombele in the summer of 2019 though that move has not worked out and the Frenchman returned to Lyon on loan for the rest of the season during the dying embers of the January transfer window.

Media reports have linked Hitchen to both Everton and Newcastle United with an official announcement from Spurs expected shortly.
