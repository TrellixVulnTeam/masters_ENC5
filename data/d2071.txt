The Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman has reportedly considered an early exit as fears of a Republican rout in the midterms leave him vulnerable amid plunging approval ratings for President Biden.

In an interview with NBC News, DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison vowed to meet his full four-year term, declaring he "made a commitment to be President."

Though a report citing current and former DNC officials announced a strained relationship between Harrison and the White House and uncertainty that he will stay in his position ahead of the midterms, which political pundits have forecast to spell disaster for Democrats.

Biden has taken a beating in polls as his approval rating proceeds to decrease, getting to 41.8% approval and 52.9% disapproval, according to the latest aggregation from pollster 538.

Prominent Pennsylvania Democrats Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and Attorney General Josh Shapiro refused to appear in a photo-op with Biden throughout his visit to the state this week. The pair cited scheduling conflicts, which some analysts noted as fairly unusual, particularly as both men are gunning for new positions this year.

One former DNC official said that Harrison has been "marginalized" because he's "not out there fighting the fight."

"You don't hear about him," another former party official announced. "You don't hear about him. You don't see him. There's nothing there."

The question remained "whether he gets out before the curtain comes down in November," as remaining in his seat would position him as the prime scapegoat should Republicans succeed in flipping both the House and Senate.

​"​We have a lot of important work left to do, which is why we want Jaime out there more, not less – more television, more campaign rallies, more fundraising," a Biden adviser stated. "He's an asset and we will need him out there for the work we have ahead."

According to NBC, current and former DNC officials, White House officials, fundraisers, donors, and Democrats in touch with the White House, who nearly universally described a strained relationship between the White House and Harrison.

Many of them announced there's blame on both sides; the White House's political arm is described as overbearing to the point that it isn't empowering its chair, while Harrison is characterized as not just having demonstrated a misunderstanding of his duties yet as too reluctant to travel beyond Columbia, South Carolina, where he lives with his wife and children.

"There's blame to be shared," announced a person familiar with the dynamics who continued that the White House has not been able to devise an effective political strategy or a clear message for Harrison to carry to help reverse Biden's slide. "Has he demonstrated that he's going to move heaven and earth to raise money and defend the Administration? No. But it's pretty impossible to defend what's happening and not happening."
