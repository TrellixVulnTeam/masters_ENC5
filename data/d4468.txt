American workers are quitting at record rates, suggesting that they’re confident they can easily find new jobs. Wages are rising rapidly, suggesting that labor currently has a lot of bargaining power. These are the hallmarks of an economy at or near full employment. At the same time, inflation is running uncomfortably high.

All of this says that it’s time for the Federal Reserve to cool things down, which it has indeed said it will do; it’s planning a series of interest rate hikes over the year ahead, with the pace of those hikes dependent on the data.

But can the Fed pull this off without sending us into a recession? It will be tricky, for reasons I’ll get to. But I keep seeing people drawing parallels between recent inflation and the inflation of the 1970s, with the implication that disinflation will be as ugly as it was last time. So it’s important to understand why that comparison is misleading.
