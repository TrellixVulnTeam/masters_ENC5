New York Republican lawmakers Nicole Malliotakis and Claudia Tenney are calling for Biden’s impeachment after it was revealed he has been illegally smuggling migrants into the country. Malliotakis noted that aiding and abetting illegal immigration violates the law. “And you have it coming from the president of the United States. It is completely unacceptable. The Supreme Court ruled that he had to reinstate Remain in Mexico and he’s clearly not done that,” Malliotakis said.

“His primary obligation as the commander in chief and the president of the United States is to enforce our laws, live up to his oath, enforce our border security. And also tell the truth to the American people,” Malliotakis stated. Since Biden is likely funneling aliens into our country for political gain, then the charges should be more significant.

Ted Cruz has previously stated that the GOP would push to remove Biden from office if they win back the house during the midterm elections. “Probably the most compelling is the utter lawlessness of President Biden’s refusal to enforce the border. His decision to just defy federal immigration laws and allow 2 million people to come here unimpeded in direct contravention of his obligation under Article 2 of the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” Cruz said. “That is probably the strongest grounds right now for impeachment, but there may be others.”

Everyone involved in this operation should be removed from their office and barred from holding any office in the future. There is no conspiracy. Images and video footage of illegal migrants being flown in under the veil of night are spreading around the internet like wildfire. The Biden Administration has failed to protect our borders and is attempting to rig the next election through their illegal activities.
