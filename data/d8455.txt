Farnesiferol C is a natural compound with various anti-cancer properties that belongs to the class of sesquiterpene coumarins. However, the low bioavailability of farnesiferol C limits its therapeutic potential. Here, we overcame this problem utilizing dendrosome nano-particles and evaluated the anti-cancer effect of dendrosomal farnesiferol C (DFC) on the AGS gastric cancer cell line. The 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were respectively used to detect the anti-proliferative properties of DFC and expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 as a hallmark of apoptosis. Compared to the void farnesiferol C (FC), our data showed that DFC significantly suppresses the proliferation of AGS cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). Also, DFC meaningfully increased the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in AGS cells (P<0.01). The findings demonstrate that our nano-based formulation of farnesiferol C could be considered as a potential therapeutic agent in cancer targeting.
