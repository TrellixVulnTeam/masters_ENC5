Despite the warning signs, I have managed to get to my forties without having consistently worn an eye cream. Even though experts have always insisted that the skin around the eyes is more delicate, thus prone to fine lines and crepey-ness, I have always relied upon my face cream to do the job - there’s always concealer for dark circles, after all.

But that was before I met Jeanette Thottrup, founder of Seed to Skin, one of the few natural skincare lines with proven anti-ageing trials to its name.

When she introduced me to The Eye Rescue Light Time Recovery and Night Time Recovery Duo, a day and night time eye care recovery system, I broached my cynicism about whether investing in an eye cream - let alone two - is really worth it? ‘Trust me, when you hit 50, you’ll wish you’d used an eye cream earlier,’ she said definitively.

If I’m honest, while my eyes haven’t yet succumbed to noticeable wrinkles, I do have a little droopiness that worsens when I’m tired.

The Light Time Recovery Cream is packed with brightening and tightening ingredients like vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, probiotics to reduce inflammation, and proven anti-ager niacinamide (vitamin B3). While the Night Time Recovery Cream has the addition of a patented lipid complex and caffeine to de-puff and reduce dark circles, among other clinically proven actives.
