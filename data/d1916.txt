Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary since the military takeover of the civilian government in Myanmar that's so far killed thousands, locked up former leaders and left the country in a state of economic and political upheaval.

On Feb. 1, 2021, military leaders in the Asian nation seized control of the government, announced a national emergency and detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other top officials -- saying that they were all elected through an illegitimate and fraudulent election. The elections in November 2020 were the second since Myanmar transitioned from a military dictatorship to a democracy.
