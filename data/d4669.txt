DAN Walker took his Strictly partner Nadiya Bychkova for a golf lesson today after they reunited in his hometown of Sheffield.

The BBC Breakfast host, 44, introduced the beauty to one of his favourite sports after she arrived in the city while touring with Strictly Come Dancing Live.

Nadiya is due to perform on stage tonight but managed to fit in a quick lesson.

Nadiya's new boyfriend and Strictly co-star Kai Widdrington then bonded with Dan over a round of golf and snapped a photo on the course.

The pair posed for a selfie together and Dan was seen cheering on Kai as he sunk "a big one on the 9th hole" in a video on Instagram.

The social media posts comes days after Dan's dance partner Nadiya was pictured snogging fellow pro Kai just ten days after insisting they were not an item.

The couple’s very public display of affection followed a mid-afternoon flit away from tour co-stars.

Professional dancers Nadiya, 32, and Kai, 26 — who have constantly denied any romance — kissed in a bar during a 30-minute visit to the Malmaison Newcastle last Thursday.

A source said: “Nadiya and Kai met away from the other dancers and celebrities who were a mile up the road in the Travelodge.

“She had bought Kai a coffee from Starbucks next door and they talked and cuddled before having a kiss.

“They didn’t seem to care who could see them. It’s clear they are massively loved up.

“They didn’t want anyone gossiping. There’s already been so much speculation.

“But since they have been so overt with their displays of affection, they might as well have had a kiss in the Travelodge and saved the journey.”

The Sun understands Nadiya and Kai started dating early on in the show, where they developed a close bond.

Nadiya split from footballer Matija Skarabot, 33, last year. They have a daughter aged five.

In recent weeks, Nadiya has repeatedly been seen with and without her engagement ring.

Kai cut short questions when asked about Nadiya during a press call for the Strictly tour.
