Peter Aldous, the MP for Waveney, announced he was the latest writing to party officials demanding a confidence vote in Mr Johnson after Sue Gray’s report condemned a “failure of leadership” at Number 10.

But the Prime Minister’s allies remain convinced the rebels are far short of the 54 letters needed to trigger a contest.

In a statement, Mr Aldous said: “After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the Prime Minister should resign.

“It is clear that he has no intention of doing so and I have therefore written to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, advising him that I have no confidence in the Prime Minister.”

Around 10 Tories have written to call for a confidence vote, although some are understood to have withdrawn their letters.

Meanwhile, Newsnight’s presenter Emily Maitlis, 51, has apologised for retweeting a message criticising the “sheer tawdry Trumpian shabbiness” of the Government’s response to the No10 parties.
