Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) “has never really danced around his ambition — including now that his party is in a holding pattern waiting to see whether former President Donald Trump runs again,” NBC News reports.

Said Cruz: “The race in ’24 will very much hinge on whatever President Trump decides to do. President Trump is going to make his decision whether or not he runs, or nobody else is going to make that decision for him. And I expect that everyone else will react accordingly when he does make that decision.”

Said someone close to Cruz: “I don’t think he would run against Trump. I don’t know that Trump’s going to run. But if Trump doesn’t run, I’m quite certain he will run.”
