SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — The Bernalillo County Commission on Wednesday appointed former commissioner Art De La Cruz to the New Mexico House of Representatives.

It was vacated by Rep. Brittney Barreras, who announced her resignation Friday.

Barreras was halfway through her first term when she abruptly resigned through a statement issued by the Democratic caucus.

She said “all of the pressure and stress” had taken a toll on her mental health.

The commission voted 4-1 to appoint De La Cruz over two other candidates.

The county commission previously appointed De La Cruz to the seat in 2020 to fill a vacancy.

Her ran as a write-in candidate in the November 2020 election, but lost to Barreras.
