THE number of Covid cases in Southampton increased by 423 in 24 hours, the latest figures show.

A total of 59,851 people had been confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19 in the city when the UK coronavirus daily dashboard was updated on January 28 – up from 59,428 on Thursday.

This is the latest data available, as the Government website with the interactive map undergoes a lengthy update.

The rate of infection in Southampton now stands at 23,669 cases per 100,000 people, lower than the England average of 24,571.

Across the UK, the number of recorded cases increased by 88,506 over the period, to 16,333,980.

However, there were no new coronavirus deaths recorded in the latest 24-hour period in Southampton.

The dashboard shows 411 people had died in the area by January 28 (Friday) – which was unchanged from Thursday.

It means there have been three deaths in the past week, which is the same as the previous week.

They were among 19,823 deaths recorded across the South East.

The figures include anyone who died within 28 days of a positive test result for Covid-19, and whose usual residence was in Southampton.

Daily death counts are revised each day, with each case backdated to the actual date of death, so some areas might see their figures revised down.

The figures also show that two-thirds of people in Southampton have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine.

The latest figures show 167,331 people had received both jabs by January 27 (Thursday) – 68% of those aged 12 and over, based on the number of people on the National Immunisation Management Service database.

People with a positive lateral flow test no longer need to take a follow-up PCR test to confirm the result unless they have coronavirus symptoms.

UK case numbers currently only include LFT results for England and Northern Ireland, with lateral flow testing data for Scotland due to be added in the coming weeks.

Across England, 84% of people aged 12 and above had received a second dose of the jab.

Unlike at local level, the national rate was calculated using mid-2020 population estimates from the Office for National Statistics.
