Vanity Fair: “Donors were trying to distance themselves from the GOP around this time last year, and for good reason: Donald Trump had fomented a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and his allies in the House and Senate still voted to overturn the 2020 election results. Revelations about Trump’s efforts to subvert democracy — and the complicity of Republican lawmakers — have only multiplied in the 12 months since, thanks to the work of the congressional committee investigating January 6 and to Trump’s own cavalier admissions.”

“But if the GOP had ever truly become a pariah to the donor class, that no longer appears to be the case: Both Trump and his party are raising money hand over fist, with Republicans outpacing Democrats in fundraising ahead of this fall’s crucial midterms where Republicans could not only regain control of Congress, but set the stage for the former president to launch another White House bid.”
