A CAT owner is counting the cost after his pet traipsed thick black oil throughout the house.

Jamie Knight, 34, woke in the middle of the night to find Darwin had left filthy paw prints all over the cream carpets.

He said: “I jumped out of bed to find Darwin covered head to toe in oil. It was like he had been completely submerged.

“I was so shocked and upset, and worried someone had dunked him in it. He was distressed.”

Jamie, of Great Barr, Birmingham, had no luck cleaning Darwin with washing-up liquid and took him to the vet.

He said the vet “had never seen anything like it”, but got him clean.

Jamie added: “The carpets are all totally ruined and we’ll need new ones. It will cost a bomb.”

“People should try to be more mindful if they have containers of oil.

“They should put covers over it so that this doesn't happen to anyone else's pet."
