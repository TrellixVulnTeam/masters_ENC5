AARON RAMSEY's loan transfer to Rangers means his Juventus contract extension CANNOT be automatically triggered.

The midfielder completed a deadline day move to the Scottish champions, handing him a fresh start after his Juve nightmare.

According to Giacomo Scutiero, if Ramsey had stayed at the Turin-based club until June, a contract extension would have been automatically triggered.

The extension would have kept Ramsey on Juve's books until 2024, unless they managed to sell him.

But Ramsey's loan to Rangers reportedly renders that extension void.

The 31-year-old is looking forward to his new challenge in Scotland.

Rangers face a fight to hold onto the Scottish title with rivals Celtic trailing by two points after 23 games played.

Ramsey scoops a mammoth £400,000-a-week, but Rangers will only contribute a fraction of his enormous wages, with Juve paying the rest.

On the move, Ramsey told Rangers' official website: “I am really pleased to be joining a club like Rangers, where there is so much to look forward to between now and May.

“I had a number of offers on the table, but none matched the magnitude of this club, with European football and the chance to play in front of 50,000 fans every other week.

“I have had some fantastic conversations with the manager and Ross Wilson, and I’m really looking forward to working with both of them, and to meeting the supporters.”
