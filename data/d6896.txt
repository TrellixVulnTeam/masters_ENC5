Donald Trump has turned on one of his most loyal Republican allies, Lindsey Graham, after he dismissed the former president’s suggestion that he would pardon 6 January rioters who have faced criminal sentences.

Mr Trump floated the idea over the weekend, putting him at odds even with many Republicans. When Mr Graham also took against it, Mr Trump told a Newsmax interviewer that his dogged ally “doesn’t know what he’s talking about” and even called him a “RINO”, – one of his and his followers’ go-to insults for those who don’t toe the line.

Meanwhile, as the 6 January House Select Committee looks into the former president’s role in sowing distrust over the outcome of the 2020 election, his company’s financial affairs are also being forensically examined by investigators in New York, Letitia James.

The Trump family have now come out swinging against her once again, Eric Trump telling the Daily Mail that “This is the opportunistic targeting of a political opponent during a campaign year. Letitia James is not working on behalf of the Attorney General's office, she is working for the DNC and using the resources of the State of New York to further her own political ambition.”
