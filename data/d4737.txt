Boris Johnson will ask Sue Gray to produce a new report into “partygate” allegations in an attempt to quell growing anger from his Tory backbenchers and save his premiership.

Ms Gray, a senior civil servant, published a 12-page "update" into the claims that revealed a gathering in the Prime Minister's own Downing Street flat was one of a dozen events being criminally investigated.

The civil servant said there had been a “failure of leadership”, warned against “excessive” drinking from government officials inside Number 10 and declared that some of the events should never have taken place.

However, Ms Gray also said she was unable to produce a “meaningful” report, because Scotland Yard had told her not to reveal details of events being looked into by police.

The Metropolitan Police later confirmed that officers were looking at a dossier of relevant material which includes more than 300 photographs and 500 pieces of written evidence.

During a bruising appearance in the House of Commons, in which he was attacked by Theresa May, the former prime minister, Mr Johnson was asked by Tory MPs - including Mark Harper, the former chief whip - if he would publish the report in its entirety.

Mr Johnson repeatedly refused to give such assurances, saying the police inquiry meant he was unable to do so.

While he was on his feet in the chamber, the Metropolitan Police issued a statement saying that such a prohibition would no longer apply once its inquiry was complete.

And just 15 minutes after he left the Chamber, Downing Street issued a statement saying that Ms Gray would be asked to publish another “update”, which would be published once received.

On Monday night, it was unclear whether that report would contain the photographs, text messages, emails and witness statements gathered by Ms Gray’s team as they interviewed more than 70 people.
