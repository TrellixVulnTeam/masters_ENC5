A MAN died in a car fire after being arrested by police for a "series of offences" the day before, a coroner has said.

Stephen Matthews, 45, suffered severe burns in the blaze he started in a car in Shop Lane, Bursledon, on March 24 last year at 7.40pm.

Police and firefighters investigating his death said the vehicle was stationary at the time and had not been involved in a crash.

The coroner concluded Mr Matthews had died by suicide having set the fire himself.

Winchester Coroner's Court was told the car exploded in the country lane and he was engulfed in flames.

The coroner's conclusion said: "He had been arrested the previous day on suspicion of a series of offences for which he was questioned in custody, being released on the evening of March 23, 2021, when he returned home to his partner.

"He left the following morning and attended work, where a letter to his partner indicating his thoughts and intent was subsequently found.

"The evidence established that the actions of the deceased were not accidental, that there were no suspicious circumstances or third party involvement in the death and that evidence existed, on the balance of probabilities, to show that he had intentionally taken his own life due to the uncertainty of the future he faced."

As reported, firefighters from St Maryâ€™s and Hightown attended the incident at 7.57pm.

"There was a vehicle on fire, which was extinguished using two breathing apparatus, three jets and a dry powder extinguisher," a fire service statement previously said.

No details have been released by Hampshire police about the nature of the arrests.
