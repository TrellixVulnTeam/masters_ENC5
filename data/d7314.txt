Feb. 1 (UPI) -- With freezing weather expected to hit a large portion of Texas this week, Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday tried to assure Texans that the state is better prepared this year than last, but said there could be local power outages throughout the state.

"Either ice on power lines ... could cause a power line to go down, or it could be ice on trees that causes a tree to fall on power lines," Abbott said.
