The war between Al Chapman (Michael Wildman) and Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) escalates in upcoming Emmerdale episodes – with Cain’s son Kyle (Huey Quinn) caught in the middle.

Cain is angry when he discovers that Al is moving in with Kyle, Amy (Natalie Ann Jamieson) and Kerry (Laura Norton), hating the idea of his enemy living under the same roof as his son.

Amy resents Cain’s interference in her life and threatens to fight him for custody of Kyle if he doesn’t back down – encouraged by Al, who tries to egg Amy on to get solicitors involved.

Moira (Natalie J. Robb) advises Cain to put his feud with Al to one side and concentrate on Kyle, and this seems to work for a while. Amy and Cain agree to stick to their original visitation plan and decide not to involve any solicitors.

When Al hears this he hides his disappointment from Amy and decides he needs a change of tactics – he’ll use Kyle to get at Cain.

He gives the boy an old mobile phone, knowing that Cain will be annoyed that Al has given him the gift. And sure enough, when Cain finds out about the phone his rage boils over, and soon after that Kyle goes missing.

A devastated Cain realises that Al has manipulated him.

But where is Kyle?

Has Al put him in danger?
