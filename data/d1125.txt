"Belarus is not the first country where the working hours of US foreign missions have been changed. It is the right of the US side to make such decisions. We look at it calmly. We will, as before, fulfil all our obligations to protect diplomatic missions. So neither American nor any other diplomats are in danger here. According to many ratings, Belarus is a much safer and more hospitable country than the United States", Glaz said.
