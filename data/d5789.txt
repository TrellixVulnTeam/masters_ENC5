Another big business entity is telling its corporate employees to become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or lose their job. Corporate employees with T-Mobile were warned to take the necessary action by April 2, according to a company memo posted on the blog, The T-MO Report.

Staff members who are only partly vaccinated by Feb. 21 will be placed on unpaid leave until they are deemed fully vaccinated. The memo addressed to “all employees (excluding international),” stated that the vaccine rules do not apply to field technicians and multiple retail roles.

However, employees who have a pending or approved medical or religious exemption through T-Mobile’s human resources department are “excluded from this action” until their accommodation becomes official. Vaccination requirements have been a disputed issue, leading to numerous lawsuits with some arguing it’s an overreach by the federal government.

In a statement on Saturday, T-Mobile said “we are requiring office workers (with limited exception for certain roles, locations and legally mandated accommodations and exemptions) to be fully vaccinated by April 2.” It added that “badge-controlled offices continue to be accessible only to those who are vaccinated against COVID-19.”
