Piers Morgan has wished Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang good luck at Barcelona and blasted Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta for ‘publicly humiliating’ the striker.

Aubameyang, 32, will likely go down as one of Arsenal’s greatest ever goalscorers after netting 92 times in 163 games during an especially difficult time for the north London outfit.

But the Gabon international was frozen out of the first-team and stripped of the captain’s armband following a disciplinary breach in December and looks certain to have played his final match for the Gunners, with his contract due to expire in the summer.

After some confusion, Barca agreed a last-ditch deal to take Aubameyang on loan on transfer deadline day and the Catalan giants are expected to unveil their big-name signing in the coming hours.

The decision has divided Arsenal supporters given it leaves Arteta with just two recognised centre-forwards in Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah – who have scored just six league goals between them this term – for the second half of the campaign.

TV personality and life-long Arsenal fan, Morgan, was quick to pass on his best wishes as news of Aubameyang’s switch broke on Monday evening.

But Morgan, an outspoken critic of Arteta on various issues, pulled no punches with his assessment of the Spaniard’s handling of the situation in recent weeks.

‘Goodbye ⁦@Auba⁩ – 92 goals in 163 games for Arsenal, Premier League golden boot winner, and one of our best ever strikers who always played with such joy until our manager began publicly humiliating you,’ he tweeted.

‘Thanks for everything, Pierre-Emerick, and good luck at Barcelona.’

Arsenal had been keen to strengthen up front at the start of the window, with Dusan Vlahovic identified as the club’s top target.

But the Gunners were beaten to Vlahovic’s signature by Juventus and moves for Real Sociedad’s Alexander Isak and Real Madrid’s Luka Jovic failed to get off the ground.

Speaking on talkSPORT, Darren Bent suggested Arsenal had actually ‘gone backwards’ after such a ‘poor’ few weeks in the transfer market.

‘They let all these players go without bringing one person in,’ the ex-Tottenham and England striker said.

‘When you think about top-four situation which is wide open, the likes of Manchester United, West Ham, Tottenham – you see them strengthening with a midfielder and an attacker.

‘You look at them and then you add Arsenal into the mix and what have Arsenal done to strengthen their top-four chances? If anything they’ve gone backwards.

‘I get that Aubameyang is not involved in the squad, but the likes of Maitland-Niles, Chambers… I know these guys are maybe not good enough to play week-in, week-out, but they’re just extra bodies in case the worst comes to the worst and you get hit with injuries, Covid-19 or suspensions.

‘I guess West Ham fans will probably be in the same boat. They’ve not done any business and they’re probably thinking it’s been a poor window.

‘But if you’re Spurs and Manchester United you’re absolutely rubbing your hands together, thinking: “That’s them out the mix!”‘
