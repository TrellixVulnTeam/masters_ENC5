PARENTS are urged to buy their kids old-fashioned “brick” mobiles to protect them from bullying.

Former Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield said using 90s-style devices like a Nokia, below, as “training phones” would help to combat online grooming.

Ms Longfield told The Sun parents should “think carefully” before giving children a smartphone.

She said: “That is a really powerful computer in their hands. Do they need that?

“If it is just about keeping in touch, what about an old-fashioned phone so they can get a really simple text?

“Think about a brick phone. You don’t want them to go straight to something online you would be horrified to be on.”

Ms Longfield also said more must be done to police social media.

The Government’s Online Safety Bill will put a new legal duty of care on tech giants.
