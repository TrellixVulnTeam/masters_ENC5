The UFC is set to return to London after three years away next month, and tickets are now on sale.

The event, on March 19, will be headlined by British heavyweight Tom Aspinall, as he takes on Russian Alexander Volkov.

The evening’s card will also feature Liverpool lightweight Paddy Pimblett.

The hugely popular fighter has promised another spectacular finish and he is already dreaming of a fight at Anfield.

The 27-year-old will take on Kazula Vargas at the O2 Arena on March 19 aiming to build on a memorable debut victory over Luigi Vendramini in September.

Speaking ahead of the UFC’s return to London, UFC President Dana White said “Every time we put on an event in London it’s an unbelievable experience. The fans are incredible, and the fights are always off the charts.

"It’s a different kind of energy in England. And I can’t wait to get back there with a fight card on 19th March.”
