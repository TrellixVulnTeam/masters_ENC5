The release of the footage, during which Young is heard sobbing, saying over and over, “You got the wrong place,” and much of which has already been aired by media outlets, was done “to ensure complete transparency on the search warrant conducted on Ms. Young’s home, as well as full cooperation with the ongoing investigation”’ according to an emailed statement from Chicago police Superintendent David Brown on Wednesday evening.
