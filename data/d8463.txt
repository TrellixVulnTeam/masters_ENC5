Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide; therefore, there is an urgent need to find safe and effective therapies. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is diagnosed in ca. 15-20% of BC and is extremely aggressive resulting in reduced survival rate, which is mainly due to the low therapeutic efficacy of available treatments. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an interesting therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancer; the photosensitizers with good absorption in the therapeutic window, combined with their specific targeting of cancer cells, have received particular interest. This review aims to revisit the latest developments on chlorin-based photoactive molecules for targeted therapy in TNBC. Photodynamic therapy, alone or combined with other therapies (such as chemotherapy or photothermal therapy), has potential to be a safe and a promising approach against TNBC.
