NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. — Sunday was not unfolding as planned for the Iona College men’s basketball team. Visiting St. Peter’s was playing rough-and-tumble ball, which had landed Iona in foul trouble and out of sorts. The frustration was evident when Nelly Junior Joseph, a sophomore center for Iona, tussled fiercely enough over a held ball with St. Peter’s Hassan Drame that both players drew technical fouls in an incident that nearly precipitated a brawl.

And when Jaylen Murray banked in a long 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer to put St. Peter’s ahead, it would have been easy for the Gaels to think — as they retreated to the locker room — that maybe it was not their day.

But moments of frustration, or resignation, did not linger. Iona cranked up its defense, sped up its offense and raced off with a comfortable 85-77 victory, ensuring that the only remaining drama in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference would be whether Iona (18-3, 10-0) could become the first team to finish unbeaten in league play since La Salle did it 32 years ago.

As the game ended, Iona Coach Rick Pitino was awarded the game ball for his 800th career college victory, though that total incorporates the 123 victories — including the 2012-13 season’s national championship — at Louisville that were wiped out by the N.C.A.A. after a scandal that centered on players and recruits being provided strippers and prostitutes.
