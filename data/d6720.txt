Police in Glasgow are appealing for information that could help them trace a man last seen leaving a hotel in the city's west end.

Brian Andrew, 41, was spotted leaving a hotel on Buckingham Terrace at around 2pm on Monday January 31 2022.

He has not been seen since, and a missing person's report has been filed with Police Scotland.

Investigators believe that Brian may have been heading in the direction of Glasgow's Botanical Gardens on Great Western Road.

He is described as white, of slim build, around 5ft 5ins tall with short black hair. He was wearing dark clothing when he was last seen.

Greater Glasgow officers have issued CCTV of him in a bid to jog locals' memories.

Inspector Bart Simonis, of Glasgow’s Response Policing Unit, said: “We are becoming increasingly concerned for Brian’s welfare and are appealing for assistance to help trace him safe and well.

“I would ask if you noticed anyone matching this description in the area or have any information on Brian’s whereabouts to contact police.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact the police non-emergency line on 101, quoting incident number 2370 of Monday, 31 January, 2022.
