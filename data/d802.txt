WWE legend Rey Mysterio gave Bad Bunny his mask in an emotional moment after the Royal Rumble.

The former world champion and the Grammy Award-winning star both took part in the 30-man match on Saturday night, and they shared a sweet exchange backstage after the show.

Rey posted a video on Instagram showing him with a white towel over his head hiding most of his face and his mask in his hand as he gave it to Bad Bunny as a show of respect.

‘Although there was a competition, this is definitely for Bunny, man. Thank you very much!’

The two then exchange words in Spanish as they embrace and the singer clutches the mask to his chest.

The star was clearly moved by the gesture, which comes after he made his second official in-ring match for the wrestling giant.

Bunny first appeared at the 2021 Royal Rumble where he performed his track Booker T alongside the Hall of Famer of the same name, and later attacked The Miz and John Morrison in the Rumble match.

The musician – who also held the 24/7 Championship – became embroiled in a feud with the duo as he had Damian Priest by his side, and the storyline culminated in a tag team match at WrestleMania 37.

Bunny impressed fans and wrestlers alike with his dedicated and skill in the bout, even hitting a Canadian Destroyer on Morrison before he and Priest picked up the win.

He hadn’t been seen on WWE TV since, but he made his return as an entrance in the 2022 Men’s Royal Rumble, where he eliminated Sheamus and Dolph Ziggler, and hit the Destroyer again to the delight of the crowd.

However, he fell short despite making it to the final five, as eventual winner Brock Lesnar rocked him with an F-5 before throwing him over the top rope.

Meanwhile, reports after the event have suggested Bad Bunny is part of the WWE family at this point, and will be free to return and give involved as and when he wants to.
