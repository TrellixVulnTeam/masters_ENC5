Tax revenues collected in West Virginia last month were more than 29% above receipts at the same point of the previous fiscal year, Gov. Jim Justice said Wednesday.

January collections totaled $573 million, which was nearly $137 million above estimates, the Republican governor said in a news release.

For the first seven months of the fiscal year, collections of $3.1 billion were about $531 million above the year-to-date estimate, the statement said. It's a record for total surplus through the month of January, Justice said.

Also in January, the state set records for the highest year-to-date amounts collected from personal income, consumer sales and severance taxes on industries such as coal, oil and natural gas.
