CHELSEA are reportedly in talks with Ousmane Dembele over a free transfer summer switch.

The 24-year-old French star left Borussia Dortmund for Barcelona back in 2017 but he has failed to sparkle at the Nou Camp.

The attacker’s contract with the LaLiga giants expires in June and he looks unlikely to be staying put under Xavi.

Reports emerged yesterday that Chelsea were in discussions with Dembele as hopes mounted over a potential transfer deadline day swoop.

But The Athletic state ‘the talks Chelsea have held with his representative have been geared more towards the possibility of a free transfer in the summer’ instead.

The winger was told by the Catalans to sign a new contract or look for another club.

The 2018 World Cup winner chose the latter option having failed to agree terms on a new deal.

That led to Barcelona allegedly making him available for £18 million during the window but he did not secure an early exit.

And the same story states ‘it is understood at least three of that group’ are growing frustrated.

And it adds that the threesome are all considering their futures in West London.
