Some of the worst impacts were still unfolding, with temperatures dropping below freezing in Arkansas, where the National Guard was deployed, and police officers in Lubbock, Texas, trying to convince people to seek shelter.

“If anybody who’s obviously homeless is set up with a campsite, or whatever the case may be, we’re not looking to tear down the campsite,” said Sgt. Steven Bergen of the Lubbock police. “We just want them to survive the night.”

More than 2,100 flights were canceled nationwide, according to FlightAware, a tracking website, and Amtrak paused train service across the Midwest and the South. Forecasters said that ice could make travel impossible in the Missouri Bootheel, the southeasternmost part of the state, and that up to an inch of ice could form in Memphis, where the possibility of falling trees and power outages loomed. Other areas of Tennessee prepared for the prospect of flooding.

“Any ice around here is uncommon and could cause glazes and road issues,” said Faith Borden, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Nashville. “We are not used to that around here. That could be a problem.”

That icy cocktail of precipitation had many residents bracing for the worst.

“Everyone is dreading the power going out,” said Chris Gilbert, an employee at an Ace Hardware store in Germantown, Ohio, south of Dayton, where customers were rushing to buy shovels.
