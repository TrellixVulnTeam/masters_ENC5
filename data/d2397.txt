"Beware of [retinol] if you have rosacea or otherwise sensitive skin. It basically speeds up skin cell turnover, and for some people, apparently, it leads to a few weeks of redness, dryness, peeling and inflammation, until the skin 'acclimates.' For me, the horrible feeling of my face burning off from inside and redness and peeling that left my skin cracked and infected never stopped until I stopped using the retinol."

"Please be sure to see a dermatologist, just in general, but especially before using this. That's how I learned I had rosacea and should never, ever use retinol. Hyaluronic acid, however, has been very kind to me."
