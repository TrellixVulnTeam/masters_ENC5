Congress is expected to accept the electoral votes on Jan. 6, just a few days away. Discontent among Republicans has been bubbling to the surface since the Nov. 3 election.

President Trump insists he easily won the election but has had it stolen from him, and the evidence is there to back up his claim.

More than a dozen House Republicans have instigated a process of objection to the result, and a senator is required to have the vote debated by Congress.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has become the first senator to declare he will object on Jan. 6 to the certification of the presidential electoral votes, and many others are expected to follow suit.

Meanwhile, Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) has just announced today Dec. 31, his decision to object to the Jan. 6 Electoral College certification, reported NewsThud.

Duncan said in a statement, “I swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States as a Member of Congress, and with that oath comes the vital role of ensuring the legality and integrity of our free and fair election system.”

“The 2020 election saw unprecedented institutional issues like states changing their voting systems in violation of their state constitutions, unelected bureaucrats changing election law instead of lawmakers themselves, poll watchers prohibited from doing their jobs, failure to properly scrutinize the validity of mail-in voting, and the list goes on,” he continued. “We need to shed light on the issues that took place during the 2020 election to preserve our electoral system for generations to come. Our mission is simple: Count every legal vote, throw out every illegal vote, and investigate every irregularity and allegation. All Americans should be on board with this mission.”

“On January 6, 2021, I plan to object to the Electoral College certification from states that experienced these unprecedented issues like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,” he added. “I plan to object for the people of the Third District of South Carolina and the millions of Americans who are demanding transparency into the 2020 election. We the People know this is a pivotal decision for our great country. May God bless the United States of America.”

This will allow for two hours of debate, at which time the president’s team will present their evidence of voter fraud if permitted so that the entire country can see how the election was stolen from the president.

However, both the House and the Senate will be required to vote on the issue, and with the Dems in control of the House and most Senate Republicans unlikely to protest the vote, it seems highly unlikely the vote certification will be rejected.

Hawley said on Twitter that Congress needed to pay attention to the millions of Americans raising questions about the election, especially where there were clear unconstitutional actions. His words brought down plenty of negative reactions, and one of the most bitter was an attack from the official Walmart Twitter account, as reported by RedState.

“Thanks ⁦@Walmart for your insulting condescension,” Hawley declared. “Now that you’ve insulted 75 million Americans, will you at least apologize for using slave labor?”

Walmart then attempted to backtrack, as the pushback was severe.

The tweet published earlier was mistakenly posted by a member of our social media team. We deleted the post and have no intention of commenting on the subject of certifying the electoral college. We apologize to Senator Hawley for this error and any confusion about our position.

Too late though, the horse had bolted. Expect customers to punish them.
