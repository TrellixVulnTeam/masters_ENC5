The Cameroon captain has been in sublime form at the tournament thus far, netting a brace in both matches against Burkina Faso and Ethiopia to seal the hosts’ spot in the last-16 with a game to spare. He then added to his tally during the draw with Cape Verde, and continued his run of scoring by netting against Comoros.

Indomitable Lions team-mate Karl Toko Ekambi is not far behind, with five goals after a brace against Gambia in the quarer-finals, while Malawi’s Gabadinho Mhango and Mali’s Ibrahima Kone are on three. Sadio Mane also has three, as he helped Senegal through to the final, with Mo Salah getting his second as Egypt beat Morocco.

Sofiane Boufal will not be adding to his three, while Ibrahima Kone has two goals for Mali in the tournament, both of which have come from the penalty spot. Nicolas Pepe has two goals and an assist, after he played a starring role in Ivory Coast’s progression through to the knockout stages.

Ahmed Mognia netted a brace in a famous win for Comoros over Ghana, and Jim Allevinah stepped up for Gabon in the absence of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Musa Barrow was the hero as Gambia reached the quarter-finals, and he has two goals and two assists to his name.
