A NEW Eden Project has been given the go-ahead, with plans to open the second site in the UK in 2024.

Eden Project North, in Morecambe, Lancashire, has been given the green light.

The £125m attraction will be built along Morecambe Bay, more than 20 years after the Eden Project Cornwall was first built.

The new project will be similar with four "shell-like" domes surrounded by outdoor gardens as it hopes to "reimagine the British seaside resort for the 21st century".

The domes - called the Rhythm Machine, the Bay Glade, the Bay Hall and the Natural Observatory - will have hundreds of plants and fauna inside, as well as theatrical experiences and education programmes for both kids and adults.

Also at the new Eden Project will be two restaurants with both indoor and outdoor seating, and amazing views of Morecambe Bay.

Head down to the bay and there will be a tidal swimming pool open to guests.

Ticket prices are yet to be revealed, but non-ticket holders will be able to access some of the outdoor gardens.

David Harland, Chief Executive of Eden Project International said it was a "huge moment" for the project, and they hope to find more funding by the end of the year.

The attraction hopes to welcome 760,000 guests a year, and create 400 new jobs.

Eden in Cornwall has welcomed more than 22 million visitors to date and added more than £2.2billion to the regional economy since opening in 2001.

Other projects include Eden Project Dundee, hoping to be the first of its kind in Scotland.

A new £300million attraction is to open in Blackpool, with three huge indoor theme parks, live performances and a number of rides and shows.

And huge new £250m indoor water park and spa Manchester's Therme is to open in 2023, while a £75m water park inspired by Indiana Jones could also be opening in the UK soon.
