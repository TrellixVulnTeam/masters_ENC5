Netflix, which started out as a DVD rental business before becoming a broadcasting giant, has teamed up with the Design Museum on the show.

The museum’s chief executive Tim Marlow said this summer’s exhibition was the product of a “shared commitment to storytelling”.

He said: “Marking 10 years of Netflix in the UK, this upcoming exhibition is an exciting way to show the impact this global giant has had on the entertainment industry through design.”

Netflix, which has more than 220 million subscribers around the world, launched in 1997 and slowly moved from a DVD rental firm to a broadcaster developing its own hit shows such as Orange is the New Black and Stranger Things.

One of its biggest hits is the royal family drama The Crown whose new series, with Elizabeth

playing Princess Diana, is expected to be released later this year.

Steve Johnson, vice president of Design at Netflix, said the exhibition would celebrate the company’s “design journey”.

He said: “Our new immersive exhibition will take a closer look at the key elements of the Netflix experience, its evolution over time, and our underpinning design philosophy. The exhibit will also showcase this design journey from a different perspective through fan favourites.

“When something is designed well, it makes life easier, gives us joy and brings people together. And just like entertainment, design can fundamentally change the way we live our lives.”
