Elana Meyers Taylor, a three-time Olympic medalist and one of the most decorated American bobsledders in history, said Tuesday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus shortly after arriving in Beijing for the Winter Olympics.

Meyers Taylor revealed her positive test in a post on Instagram, writing that she had tested positive on Saturday, two days after arriving in China with her husband, an alternate on the U.S. men’s team, and their young son. Now in isolation, she must return two negative test results to be released, and to compete.

“I am asymptomatic and currently at an isolation hotel — and yes I am completely isolated,” she wrote. “Getting to the Olympics is never easy, and this time, as a new mom, it has been the most challenging, but also, incredibly rewarding, to be able to show that it can still be done.”
