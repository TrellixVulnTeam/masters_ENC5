Kylie Jenner has looked to sign off the year in the only way she knows how, by posing in a barely there bikini to the delight of her fans.

The 23-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is currently holidaying in Aspen and while she has been spotted on the snowy slopes in recent days, she decided to strip down for some sizzling snaps on Wednesday.

The Kylie Cosmetics founder took to the pool in full make-up and dripping in expensive jewellery but it was the bikini that accentuated her curves which were a thirst trap for her fans.

While a few worried that she might catch a cold in the snowy climes of the ski resort in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, others thought she was on fire in her latest snaps on Instagram.

As Kylie played with inflatable beach balls in the pool, she captioned the post: "swimming into 2021"

It would seem that Kylie has been joined by family on her break to the mountains.

Her sister Kendall has been spotted in town on Tuesday, wearing a white crop top that showed off her chiselled midriff.

Kendall, 25, also shared photos of her and Kylie snowboarding as the pair indulged in a spot of adrenalin sports as well as lounging in the pool.

Kendall captioned the snaps "Sister day" as they flew down the slopes together.

Corey Gamble has also been seen in Aspen, which would suggest that Kardashians momager, Kris Jenner, is also on the trip with her daughters.

Scott Disick has seemingly shown that he may have also jetted off for the vacation with them, as he posted a photo of him posing in ski gear next to a Bugatti convertible.

The 37-year-old, who has three children with Kourtney Kardashian, was stood with the car on tarmac next to a private jet, though he didn't indicate where he may be heading as the Californian winter sun beat down.
