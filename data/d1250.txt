Paige Spiranac woke up and chose violence after the Chiefs lost to the Bengals in the playoffs.

The Bengals are headed to the Super Bowl after an overtime win over Patrick Mahomes and company. Following the loss, Spiranac fired off a hall of fame tweet about his brother Jackson and fiancée Brittany Matthews.

“Patrick Mahomes is down bad. Imagine losing today and then having to go home to Jackson and Brittany making TikToks,” Spiranac tweeted after the Chiefs were upset at home by the Bengals.

Folks, how do we report a murder on Twitter? That is about as brutal and funny as it gets. She just smoked both of Mahomes’ family members, and she did it in front of the whole country.

Go off, Paige! Go off.

It’s amazing how many people can’t stand Brittany Matthews or Jackson Mahomes. I guess that’s what happens when you routinely behave like morons.

Matthews sprayed random strangers with champagne and then acted like a victim when she got called out for it!

Luckily, we don’t have to deal with them until next season. You have no idea how happy that makes me. I could cry tears of joy.

Talk that trash, Paige! I’m right there with you.
