HUGH JACKMAN (Professor Harold Hill) It was so great to be back in the room.

KATHY VOYTKO (swing/Marian understudy) It was a thrill to test negative every day.

On Dec. 20, amid the Omicron surge, “The Music Man” had its first preview. Four covers — an actor who goes on for another actor who calls out of a show — were onstage.

KATE HORTON (executive producer) I would look at the situation we were facing each day, and I would have conversations with stage management and the creative team and we would decide what to do.

SUTTON FOSTER (Marian Paroo) At one point, there were 14 people out of the show. We had swings covering seven roles and trying to hold up that show. And they did. It was remarkable. One of our swings, Emily Hoder, is 10 years old, and she was covering three tracks.

ZAKS I couldn’t do the critical work of addressing the material, making changes in the lighting, fixing the sound, because we had so may people out. There was a moment when we asked ourselves if we’d have to push opening night.

Then it happened: On Thursday, Dec. 23, the morning of the fourth preview, Foster tested positive.

FOSTER We’ve been vigilant, but I have a 4 ½-year-old daughter who goes to preschool. On December 20, the night of our first preview, she hadn’t been feeling good, and my husband took her to the doctor and she tested positive. But every day I was testing negative, negative, negative. Then on Thursday morning, I did a rapid test at home, and it immediately was just this rude red line. And I was like, “OK, here we go.”

But the show still went on that night, thanks to Voytko, a swing and an understudy for Marian, who mainlined the role in eight hours.
