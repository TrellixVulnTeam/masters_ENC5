A group of Japanese architects have their sights set on a gigantic underwater metropolis that could be the world's first real-life Atlantis.

The Ocean Spiral City, designed by the engineering firm Shimizu Corporation, looks a bit like the Eden Project attached to a helter-skelter or a Turkey Twizzler.

It would rely on the resources of the ocean to operate and sail slowly around the world 2.5 miles beneath the surface of the water.

The spiral city could be a fix for climate change, as it will apparently create renewable energy using ocean thermal energy conversion, which creates electricity from the different levels of ocean temperature via a generator.

First unveiled in 2014, the Ocean Spiral City was tipped to be ready for its first 5,000 residents by 2030, but there's sadly been few updates on progress since.

The architects behind the idea believe we are underutilising the Earth by only living on the land.

They said: "The ocean covers roughly 70% of the earthâ€™s surface. Roughly 80% of that is deep sea.

"The deep sea holds major potential for ensuring proper cycles in the global biosphere. We have not yet taken advantage of that potential, however.

"We thought that we could utilize the limitless potential of the deep sea through a vertical connection of the atmosphere, ocean surface, deep sea, and sea floor."

The city would have a dome-like 'base camp' near the surface, then a spiral going all the way down to 4,000 meters beneath sea level where it would extract resources from the deep sea and store and reuse carbon dioxide.

The city would also have a deep sea submarine port to supply electricity, water, and oxygen to its lower depths.

The Ocean Spiral City is not the only far-fetched city concept. More recently, architects designed a gigantic skyscraper that would hang from an asteroid.

Perhaps the floating skyscraper could be attached to the floating spiral into one gigantic, ridiculous building.
