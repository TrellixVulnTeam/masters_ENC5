Former President Donald Trump applauded news of Jeff Zucker’s exit from CNN in a statement:

“Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else… Jeff Zucker is gone-congratulations to all!”
