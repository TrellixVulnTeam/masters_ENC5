Winchester – Lights in the city is running to mark the change of the seasons, with coloured lights depicting the change.

The lights are on from 4pm until midnight each day until February 6.

The trail starts at The Great Hall, signifying winter, and moves through the city before finishing at Winchester Guildhall where lights depict spring.

Councillor Martin Tod, Cabinet Member for Economic Recovery, said: “We’re not out of the woods yet with the economic impact of COVID – and this is a quieter time of year anyway – so it’s great that so many local organisations have worked together on this new event to give an extra boost to our centre and our local businesses.

“I hope this brings more people in to enjoy Winchester after dark – seeing our beautiful city lit up with projections and installations – while also giving a boost to our local economy. Economically, I really hope it does help turn Winter into Spring.”

The project has been funded through the Government’s Reopening High Street Safely and Welcome Back Fund European Regional Development Fund programme.

It has been organised by Winchester City Council which has worked with key partners across the city including Winchester Business Improvement District (BID), Play to the Crowd, Hampshire Cultural Trust and Winchester Cathedral.

Christine Cook, Managing Director at Icthus Event Solutions Ltd, which worked on the light show, said: “We hope everyone will enjoy seeing the city lit up on what can be a gloomy time of year.”
