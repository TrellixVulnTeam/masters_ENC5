You can peruse the full list of 101 California songs here or listen here.

But before we proceed, my pick: Rilo Kiley’s “Let Me Back In,” from 2013. It’s an ode to Los Angeles that centers what I’ve always loved about this city — that almost anyone can feel at home here.

“Journey is a Bay Area staple. ‘Lights’ is a love song to the city of San Francisco. The Giants will play ‘Lights’ in between the seventh and eighth innings (if the Giants are winning) and the whole ballpark sings and sways to the music. It is wonderful!” — Robin Blair, Palo Alto

“I’m 64 years young, born and raised in Southern California, and if there’s another song that so aptly describes life during my younger years, I don’t know what it is. I’ve retired to Arizona but Southern California will always be home!!” — Cheryl Brown, Surprise, Ariz.

“Where the Streets Have No Name” by U2 (1987)

“This is a song that anyone who has been out to the Mojave and has experienced the heaviness of the universe and fragility of their mortality would agree is about the spiritual growth that occurs there. Not to mention the album is called ‘Joshua Tree.’” — Ana Macías-Serpa, Arundel, Maine
