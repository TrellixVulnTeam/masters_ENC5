A survey found most Floridians are unhappy with the president’s work in Washington.

The latest Suffolk University/USA TODAY network poll discovered 53% of voters across the Sunshine State disapprove of President Joe Biden’s performance. Only 39% were happy with the incumbent’s accomplishments in the Oval Office.

About 58% of 500 respondents surveyed believe America is on the wrong track. Only 28% are optimistic about the nation’s future under the Democrat’s leadership.

Their biggest complaint was about Biden’s handling of the economy. Namely, 57% disapproved while just 36% approved.

Floridians were also displeased with the incumbent’s response to coronavirus, with 48% disapproving and 45% approving his handling of the pandemic.

When asked to list their preferred presidents in order respondents chose GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former President Donald Trump, and Biden.

Although the governor is more popular for presidency, Trump (47%) would still lead DeSantis by 7 points in a hypothetical Republican primary vote according to the poll.

“Ironically, this 2024 Florida case study could be the narrative of the 2022 midterms: party nominees, who are strong within their party but less popular among the general electorate, could win their respective party primaries but falter in the general election,” Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos said in a statement.

This statewide survey was conducted between Jan. 26 and Jan. 29, 2022. It reported an error margin of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
