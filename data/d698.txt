US Venture Capital Firm Integrity Partners Now in Negotiations for Control

The FBI bought and tested the flagship spyware of Israel’s NSO Group, Pegasus, to use it for domestic surveillance last year according to recent reports.

An investigation by Ronen Bergman and Mark Mazzetti, both journalist at The New York Times Magazine found that, beginning in 2019, the FBI paid millions to NSO as the bureau considered deploying the Pegasus surveillance tool in the U.S.

“NSO is effectively a tool of the Israeli government, one Israel uses to gain diplomatic leverage. Netanyahu used Pegasus to knit together a new generation of global far-right leaders from Israel, Poland, Hungary, India and elsewhere,” Mazzetti tweeted.
