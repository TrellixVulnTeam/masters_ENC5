In July 2019, my life took a dramatic and unexpected turn when I listened to a phone call during which the president of the United States made inappropriate and possibly unlawful demands of a foreign leader. I did my duty by reporting my concerns within the National Security Council, where I served as a director. When later subpoenaed by Congress, I testified truthfully about what I heard. As a result, my career and personal life were forever turned upside down.
