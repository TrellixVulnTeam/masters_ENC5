A reader sent me this video today…and I always love it when people send me something I haven’t seen yet.

The video is labeled “Very racist TurboTax TV Commercial” and you can see why.

Is it another big corporation trying to appease the “woke” mob?

I’m actually curious to see what you think.

Watch here and I’ll give you my take below:

My take is I don’t find it super racist, although I guarantee if the roles were reversed it would be Armageddon amongst the woke mob.

Can you imagine the outrage?

It actually feels to me like a joke that just never quite hit the punchline.

Like it could have had a really hilarious ending, but instead it just….ended with no payoff.

My take: not super racist, not super funny.

But I want to know what YOU think…
