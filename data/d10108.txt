Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The Conservative Party of Canada caucus voted Wednesday to remove Erin O'Toole as its leader, triggering what will become a second leadership race in 18 months.

O'Toole, a Member of Parliament from Ontario, knew Monday the vote was coming but had hoped to sway the required 50% support from the party's 119 MPs to hang on to power until a scheduled leadership review in 2023.
