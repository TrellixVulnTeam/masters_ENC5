Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) suffered a stroke last week and underwent surgery but is “expected to make a full recovery,” the Washington Post reports.

There are indications that the Senate Democratic leadership did not know about Lujan’s health problems until today.

Lujan’s office declined to comment when asked by NBC News when they expect the senator could return to work.
