US rapper TDott Woo has died, after reportedly being shot dead, almost two years after his friend and fellow rapper Pop Smoke died.

The rapper’s record label confirmed his death and shared a tribute to the late star, whose real name was Tahjay Dobson, writing: ‘It’s an honor to remain your friend until your last moments.

‘Your memories will always stay with us no matter where we go & what we do. Sleep in peace. #LongLiveTdott 🙏🏻

‘Just know his legacy will always live, from his laugh to the dance everyone across the world does, some of us know him a friend, brother, cousin or just a fan but we all come together to tell you FLY HIGH 🙏🏻.’

In a longer statement, the label claimed the rapper was ‘brutally murdered’ just hours after his record deal was finalised.

The statement continued: ‘TDott Woo rose to prominence for his ‘Woo Walk’ from a community where drill music has and continues to electrify the world.

‘The young rapper and dancer was a close friend of multi-charting artiste Pop Smoke and of fast-rising HipHop artist Fivio Foreign [and] has multiple music video credits under his belt but it’s his ability to dance which speaks volumes and [is a] testament to his love for the arts’.

The NYPD told Metro.co.uk in a statement: ‘On Tuesday, February 1, 2022, at approximately 1422 hours, police responded to a ShotSpotter activation at 9802 Avenue L, within the confines of the 69 Precinct.

‘Upon arrival, officers observed a 22-year-old male with a gunshot wound to the head. EMS responded and transported the aided male to Brookdale Hospital Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased.

‘There are no arrests at this time and the investigation remains ongoing. The identification is pending family notification.’

Tributes have come in for the late star, with one fan writing: ‘Tough day for us today. RIP #TDOTT,’ while another added: ‘That man literally had the best energy RIP to him.

Pop Smoke was killed in February 2020 after being shot in his own home.

Metro.co.uk has contacted the NYPD for comment.
