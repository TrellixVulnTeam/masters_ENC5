Far-left Russian collusion conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow is expected to announce a hiatus from MSNBC to her viewers on Monday night’s show.

Maddow’s break is expected to last a few weeks.

She is reportedly taking a break to re-energize and make a film with Ben Stiller.

Maddow is currently under a $30 million-a-year contract with MSNBC through 2024.



Rachel Maddow reportedly will go on hiatus from her primetime talk show on MSNBC to focus on movie and podcast projects, including a film directed by Ben Stiller. Maddow told staffers at the left-leaning, Comcast-owned network that she will step aside for a few weeks to devote time to her side projects, Business Insider reported on Monday. She is expected to announce the move to viewers during Monday night’s broadcast. Maddow will executive produce a Focus Features movie based on her book and podcast, “Bag Man,” about a political bribery scandal.
