Leftist MSNBC cable news host Rachel Maddow was caught red-handed on Thursday deceptively editing a statement given to her by the Florida Department of Health press secretary Jeremy Redfern regarding her ongoing smear job of Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, who she claims never treated COVID patients during the pandemic.

During a segment in the A-block of The Rachel Maddow Show, Maddow ranted about Dr. Ladapo, saying, "one of the ways Doctor Ladapo rose to prominence in conservative media circles and ultimately to this top medical post in Florida that Governor DeSantis put him in, was in large part on the basis of him staking his credibility on being a frontline doctor."

Maddow continued "In his conservative media appearances and his op-eds, he presented himself as a frontline doctor who spent time as a physician treating many, many, many covid patients."

Maddow claims to have "obtained scheduling documents from the time doctor Ladapo was working at UCLA. Those documents did not show Dr. Ladapo scheduled to take care of covid patients at all." The leftist anchor claimed she "contacted the Florida Department of Health seeking comment from Doctor Ladapo multiple times" but she apparently never received a response.

However, when Maddow reached out again for comment she did receive a response:

It's clear Maddow doesn't actually want a response to her inquiry because she completely edited the statement she was given by Jeremy Redfern. Below is what Maddow reported versus what Redfern actually said:

Once again what is said by Rachel Maddow is always the complete opposite of reality.

This latest example of Maddow's deception was made possible by the endorsement of Liberty Mutual and Claritin. Their contact information is linked so you can let them know about the biased news they fund.

RACHEL MADDOW: But one of the ways Doctor Ladapo rose to prominence in conservative media circles and ultimately to this top medical post in Florida that Governor DeSantis put him in, was in large part on the basis of him staking his credibility on being a frontline doctor. In his conservative media appearances and his op-eds, he presented himself as a frontline doctor who spent time as a physician treating many, many, many covid patients. And so his expertise on this matter was born out of you know the hard work that he had experienced with all his experience treating patients with covid-19. Well, we reported exclusively here a couple of months ago on evidence that called those claims into question. Doctor Ladapo wrote two op-eds in national newspapers in 2020 claiming that he had spent time taking care of covid patients, specifically at UCLA’s flagship hospital. This caught the attention of people who really did work at UCLA's hospital treating covid patients. Multiple people who worked at UCLA’s hospital at the same time as Doctor Ladapo said that he was misleading the public about his experience treating covid patients there. A member of the team treating covid patients at UCLA told us that Doctor Ladapo was not part of that team. We also obtained scheduling documents from the time doctor Ladapo was working at UCLA. Those documents did not show Dr. Ladapo scheduled to take care of covid patients at all. We contacted the Florida Department of Health seeking comment from Doctor Ladapo multiple times when we first aired this reporting, but we never heard back. We reached out again this week, and the Press Secretary for the Florida Department of Health responded by calling our request for comment, quote, cute. That was an actual quote. Thanks for reaching out to ask about this unsubstantiated conspiracy theory. It's cute that you're asking for comment. This is a state government. We then also heard from the Communications Director at the Florida Department of Health, he confirmed that Doctor Ladapo did not treat covid patients during much of 2020 when UCLA was running a covid ward, but he claimed that Doctor Ladapo must have treated patients prior to and also after that period. He told us, quote, I'm sure you can find documents that prove that if you're finding other documents to promote your narrative. Listen, we're not trying to find documents to promote a narrative, we're trying to figure out if the guy was telling the truth. And the thing is, we did try very hard to get hold of any documents that would prove that Doctor Ladapo treated covid patients at UCLA, particularly given the word from other doctors who actually did treat patients at UCLA that he was never among them and they never saw him. We have tried to find documents that would indicate that Doctor Ladapo did treat covid patients at UCLA. We cannot find any such documents. Doctor Ladapo nor the, neither Doctor Ladapo nor the Florida Department of Health has provided us any such documents in response to our request. And in all the existing records that we can find indicate lots and lots of other doctors treating covid patients at UCLA's hospital but not him.
