Saying the state has a “moral imperative” to get vaccines out as quickly as possible, Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday said the state is asking hospitals to get vaccines into arms within 24 hours of receiving them as it tries to accelerate the rate of people inoculated against the coronavirus.

DeWine said during his final scheduled briefing of 2020 that he wanted to instill a “sense of urgency” among those who are eligible for the vaccine as he also announced new guidance for quarantining students exposed to the virus in classrooms and extending a statewide curfew order until Jan. 23.

“While we can’t control how much comes in every week, we certainly can control how fast that we get it out," he said. "That is incumbent upon all of us Ohioans to make sure it gets out as fast as we can get it out. It is a lifesaver.”

Though the state has vaccinated 94,078 people already, an Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman said it expected to receive 529,900 doses by the end of the year. DeWine said on Wednesday that another 69,500 doses of the Moderna vaccine were expected next week, along with 70,200 initial doses of the two-shot protocol from Pfizer. An additional 98,475 second doses from Pfizer also are on the way.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Ohio’s vaccine rollout was moving relatively slow. While about 19.3% of vaccines had been used nationwide as of Dec. 21, according to Bloomberg, Ohio had used only 14.3% of its vaccine allotment.

DeWine declined to assign blame for the slow rollout, saying that the state was starting up an altogether new, large-scale vaccine program. The state's dashboard also is likely undercounting the true number of vaccines administered because some hospitals had trouble uploading data, he said.

Health care workers and those living and working in nursing homes and assisted living facilities already are receiving the vaccine, but DeWine said he had grown “impatient” with the pace of those who have been vaccinated.

On Wednesday, DeWine said he had a "candid discussion" with hospitals to talk about speeding up the rollout. He wants them to administer vaccines within 24 hours of receiving them and then update their records with the state within the day after.

“I’m just not satisfied with where we are in Ohio. We’re not moving fast enough. But we’re going to get there. We’re going to speed this thing up," he said.

The governor also said he was troubled by the relatively low numbers of nursing home workers who have elected to take the vaccine as it's been offered to them and warned that, if they don't get it now, they could be forced to wait for it in the future.

About 60% of nursing home staff have so far elected not to take the vaccine, DeWine said.

"We aren’t going to make them but we wish they had a higher compliance," he said. "Our message today is the train may not be coming back for a while.”

Nursing homes will get three visits for the vaccine, DeWine said. After the initial stop, nursing homes will be hit again to administer second doses for anyone who received the vaccine the first time and to give an initial dose to anyone else who wants it.

Pharmacies administering the vaccines in nursing homes then would return for a third trip to administer the second dose to anyone who had not received it yet, he said.

“Everyone makes their own choice about this but we want to make it clear that opportunity may not come back for a while," he said.

In the next phase of the rollout, adults working in schools will be eligible for the vaccine, but DeWine said the state does not yet have a start date for that. DeWine said Wednesday that the state didn't have to finish the first phase before moving on to the next, "but we have to be well on our way."

“We want them to be able to be vaccinated so that we have the opportunity for parents and the opportunity for schools to put kids back in schools,” he said.

The governor has said that about 71% of Ohio pupils are either in remote learning or in a combination of in-person and online learning, but the state wants to get pupils back in classrooms by March 1.

Children in schools also will be subject to new guidance from the state around quarantining after they have been exposed to the virus in the classroom. Previously, students who were in close contact in their classrooms with someone who had been infected were required to be quarantined under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

But DeWine said a study of some Ohio school districts found that wasn’t necessary as long as students were following protocols around wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. The change in guidance does not apply to students exposed in extracurricular activities, including sports, he said.

The governor also announced an extension of a statewide curfew, set to expire Saturday, for three weeks until Jan. 23. The 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew does not apply to those going to and from work and for other essential situations.

The extension comes as DeWine said coronavirus cases had plateaued at a “very high, high level.”

After reporting 8,178 new cases on Wednesday, the state’s total since the start of the pandemic rose to 690,748. Wednesday’s cases were above the 21-day average of 8,126.

The accelerating death toll from the virus also increased on Wednesday as the state reported 133 people had died from COVID-19. That brought the statewide total number of deaths since the start of the pandemic to 8,855.

December has been the deadliest month of the pandemic, with 2,426 deaths. The state reported at least 100 people dead from the virus on about a dozen days this month; before December, the state reported only two such days.

On Wednesday, another 366 were reported to be hospitalized with the virus in the previous 24 hours. The state reported an additional 36 were in intensive-care unit beds during that period.

Across the state, 4,409 were hospitalized because of COVID-19 on Wednesday. A total of 1,087 were in intensive-care units and 693 were on ventilators.

The positivity rate in Ohio was 19.1% as of Dec. 28, the latest date for which data were available, compared with a seven-day moving average of 13%.
