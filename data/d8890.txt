You are the company you keep — and the sleaze you defend.

What a comeuppance for Jeff Zucker, who stood by former star anchor and one-time BFF Chris Cuomo through multiple scandals.

There was no breach of journalistic ethics Chris Cuomo couldn’t commit, it seemed, without Zucker making excuses and exemptions for that self-important mediocrity.

Run around the Hamptons as Chris did, maskless and COVID-positive, yet lecture America every night on best practices? Sure.

Not to state the obvious, but: This is an ostensible news network. A news network that prides itself on being full of moral rectitude.

Yet Chris went on to fake his emergence from fake quarantine on-air; to fuzz-up brother Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s image, even as Andrew sent old people to their certain deaths; and to use his power and influence to smear the women credibly accusing Andrew of sexual misconduct.

Zucker, a lifelong network news vet, had problems with none of it. He was all too happy presiding over the idiocy and hypocrisy of Chris Cuomo’s tenure.

It always made me wonder: What might Chris have on Zucker? If Andrew’s so terrible, and Chris is so terrible, why would Zucker align with them? Unless he was actually like the Cuomo brothers too — equally terrible?

I find it hard to believe, in the #MeToo era, that Zucker’s consensual affair with an age-appropriate, high-ranking female colleague — one with her own ties to Andrew, by the way — rises to a fireable offense.

Recall that Zucker presided over Matt Lauer’s rise at “Today,” and Lauer’s terrible treatment of female colleagues was an open secret back then, too.

If Zucker was fine with Lauer’s predations, and Andrew Cuomo’s, and with Chris breaking just about every code the profession holds dear — well, it’s not hard to imagine there might be more to come.

The fish, after all, rots from the head.

Yet Zucker had the temerity to run CNN as the righteous backbone of cable news, allowing his dubious roster of on-air talent and producers, some with their own sexual predations and ethics breaches (paging Don Lemon), to lecture us night after night.

It’s all been so insufferable.

Any clear-thinking person could have told Jeff Zucker that the Cuomo brothers are garbage, that their loyalty only ever extends to each other. How poetic that Chris Cuomo, in fighting for his vulgar, unearned $18 million payout, betrayed the one man who stood by him.

And, I suspect, may betray him more still. They don’t call him Fredo for nothing.
