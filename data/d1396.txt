‘CBS Mornings’ on Monday suggested Joe Rogan is killing people via his podcast when discussing Covid-19.

Corporate media is trying to get highly popular podcaster Joe Rogan censored and tossed from Spotify for daring to discus Covid vaccines and various early treatment such as Ivermectin.

The left-wing media and Biden’s surgeon general called for Joe Rogan to be silenced because he interviewed Dr. Malone and discussed the dangers of the mRNA Covid gene therapy vaccine.

The ‘CBS Mornings’ hosts claimed they support the First Amendment but not for Joe Rogan because his show is “dangerous.”

“You have a First Amendment right to say what you want. You don’t have a First Amendment right to appear on a platform as large as Spotify, that’s the issue,” one of the hosts said.

Covid is a “life and death issue,” the fake news anchors argued.
