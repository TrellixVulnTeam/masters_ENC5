Coronation Street’s Sally Lindsay has hit out at those who think landing a role in the ITV soap ‘think it’s all about being famous.’

Sally played Shelley Unwin from 2001-2006, and has also spoke about her frustrations over being criticised for doing a variety of jobs within the industry.

‘A lot of people, when they join Coronation Street, think it’s all about being famous and… going to awards and that’s it, you’re made. And you’re not. You’re really not’, she told Kate Thornton, host of the White Wine Question Time podcast.

She continued: ‘You know, you’ve got someone like Bradley Walsh, who does everything and people say “oh that’s amazing”, but if you do it, they’re like, “aren’t you an actor though?”. Yeah, yeah, I am, I’m a really good one, but I can do that as well.’

Sally’s exit storyline in Coronation Street saw her character offered a new job in the Peak District.

In the lead up to her exit, Shelly got pregnant after a one night stand with Charlie Stubbs.

Since her time in Corrie, Sally has gone on to appear in a variety of different TV shows including Scott & Bailey and Cold Call.

Last year, she played the role of Jean White in The Madame Blanc Mysteries on Channel 5.
