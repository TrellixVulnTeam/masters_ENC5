Ten-month-old Akol is dying. She weighs less than 10 pounds. She should weigh more than 22 pounds at her age. Without food, the little one won’t survive.

Akol’s mother, Nyirou, desperately wants her to make it. And with your help, she can.

Many other children, like Akol, need food now. With COVID-19, food in remote areas of Africa is even more scarce.

Ann Pretorius, who has served in Africa for decades, has seen firsthand what malnutrition can do to a generation of children. She recently told LIFE’s mission team, “The hunger crisis across Africa in the wake of COVID-19 is potentially going to take more lives than the virus itself.”

That’s why your gift of love is so important. There are only a few days left this year to raise all the funds for Mission Feeding. Please consider your most generous gift at this special time to help feed precious children and keep all of LIFE’s outreaches going strong. You might consider this a Christmas gift honoring the Lord and His gift of life to us, which we celebrate during this season.

Also, remember year-end gifts make a great impact at this time.

With your help, Mission Feeding won’t stop. If at all possible, please let us hear from you by December 31st.
