A recently-discovered Orange County Superior Court document alleges Ahmad Zahra used force against a woman and destroyed a cell phone, as well as other property.

The alleged incident happened around Sept. 20, when Zahra was arrested for assault; he was later charged with battery. Court records do not yet show a trial date.

Zahra was elected to the Fullerton city council in 2018, and previously worked as a film producer.

He did not respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times.
