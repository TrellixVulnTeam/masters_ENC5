ITV have confirmed that this year's series of Love Island will be filmed in 'brand new villa'.

It was recently reported that the current property in Sant Llorenç des Cardassar, in the north-east of Majorca was going to be axed.

And on Tuesday, ITV cemented the news in a statement which read: "The ultimate Summer of love is on the horizon as Love Island makes it's long awaited return, direct from a brand new villa in Mallorca.

They added: "Applications are currently open for singletons looking for a long, hot Summer…"

Producers have already started recruiting for the next series and for the first time in the show's history, producers have changed the application process to allow non-binary, gay and bisexual people to apply to be on the show.

The new form allows people to choose their gender from one of the following options: male, female, non-binary, prefer not to say and prefer to self-describe. Sexual orientation also gives five different options - straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or other.

ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo had previously explained how bosses were struggling to include gay couples in the show - as they admitted they had yet to "find a way" to do so.

"Love Island is a particular thing, of course, it’s about boys and girls coupling up," he said. "So if you wanted to do a gay version, or you wanted to widen it, it is discussed and we haven’t yet found a way that would make it suitable for that show."
