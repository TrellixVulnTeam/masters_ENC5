The rhetoric between Moscow and NATO allies over Ukraine stepped up another unpleasant notch today.

The Kremlin called Boris Johnson “utterly confused” and ridiculed what it said was the “stupidity and ignorance” of British politicians.

Later, in a phone call between Mr Johnson and Vladimir Putin – the prime minister used the more expected diplomatic language of “deep concern” over the situation on the Ukrainian border.

Meanwhile, the United States announced it is sending 3,000 troops to Eastern Europe.
