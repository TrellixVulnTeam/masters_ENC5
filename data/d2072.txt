BOOOOOM: TIP OFF THAT AGENTS WERE GOING TO BLOW UP OTTAWA WAS BANG ON

THEY INTEND TO USE CLASS 4 EXPLOSIVES.

CLASS 4 EXPLOSIVES ARE SAFE TO HANDLE AND ARE WHAT GOES IN FIREWORKS.

Police dressed exactly like the goons in Ottawa were in London Ontario with about 200 pounds of class 4 explosives in a hotel there, most likely to assemble devices that would be used in an Ottawa psy op.

What else would they have a bunch of class 4 explosives for RIGHT NOW? Riddle me that!!!

They may have also assembled explosive devices elsewhere, but London Ontario is a guarantee.

London is far enough away to "avoid suspicion" and close enough to "get it there".

The type of explosive they plan on using will make a LOT of noise (way more than other more powerful explosives) while they do little damage.

They want to make a show, and 200 pounds of class 4 explosives would definitely accomplish a "show".

HERE IS THE PROOF THEY ARE DOING THIS, EFFING GREAT, LOVIN IT!!!! BUUUUSSSSTED!!!

There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY that ANY action by police could justify having this explosive material, especially that much, other than a false flag.

They probably decided on class 4 because it would be easier to get than other types, while it makes VERY loud booms and does little damage.

The higher class explosives are not as loud because their shock wave moves so fast the air can't catch up.

If you want to give air a big audible push, class 4 is what you use.

THIS IS JUST SO PERFECT.

I was nervous about my post about them "blowing the place up" because that's a great way to look stupid if it does not pan out.

My tip-off had better be right when I post like that.

But it DID pan out, they really freaking ARE going to set off explosives but it will ALL...BE..HOLLYWOOD.

THEY ARE USING HOTEL ROOMS TO ASSEMBLE THE DEVICES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT ANY TRACE OF THAT AT THE POLICE STATIONS TO BE INCRIMINATED WITH, WHILE THEY DROP BREAD CRUMBS AT THE HOTEL FOR INVESTIGATORS TO FOLLOW AND "SOLVE A TERROR CASE" FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION.

THEY MIGHT EVEN WANT GREATER CONTROLS PUT ON HOTEL ROOMS OVER THIS, LIKE PERHAPS A DIGITAL VAX PASSPORT.

GUY SAID "SECOND AMENDMENT" so you know he's an American and he was nervous, he should have said first which would not apply in Canada anyway, but whatever, HE BUSTED THEM COLD AS A CUCUMBER...LOVIN IT!!!!
