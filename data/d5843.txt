The 62-year-old music mogul was reportedly flung over his handlebars at 20mph close to his west London home — leaving him bloody, bruised and with a suspected broken arm.

A source told The Sun: “Simon is lucky to be alive. He was pedalling along, with his electric motor on, when the wheels suddenly went from under him after hitting a wet patch.

“He slipped and went flying over the handlebars into the middle of the road.”

The source added the bloodied face of Cowell looked like something from the Phantom of the Opera as he was helped by three bystanders.

The Britain’s Got Talent supremo will have to wear a cast for filming the latest series of the reality show.

His son Eric, 7, has already drawn pictures of their dogs Squiddly and Diddly on the cast as Cowell emerged from hospital on Tuesday night.

The crash came just 18 months after Cowell broke his back riding another e-Bike in Malibu in August 2020.

He underwent six hours of surgery – which involved having a metal rod put in his back.

The music mogul admitted he “couldn’t have gotten through” the trauma without then girlfriend Lauren Silverman and son Eric, seven, who, Cowell said, called him “iron man” when he first saw his father with metal rods in his spine following surgery.

He has reportedly promised his new fiancee Lauren Silverman, 44, to wear a helmet from now on.
