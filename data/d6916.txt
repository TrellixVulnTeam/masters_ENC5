The BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron, which some studies indicate could be even more infectious than the original version, has now been found in 57 countries, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday.

In its weekly epidemiological update, the WHO said there are now four sub-variants of Omicron which collectively account for over 93 per cent of all coronavirus specimens collected in the past month.

“BA.2-designated sequences have been submitted to Gisaid from 57 countries to date,” the WHO said. It added that in some countries, the sub-variant now accounted for more than half of all sequenced Omicron cases.

Meanwhile, tsunami-struck Tonga has entered its first ever Covid lockdown, as five cases of Covid have been found there.

Elsewhere, in the UK, the government has been accused of “wasting” £8.7bn on “unusable” PPE during the pandemic.

New documents from the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) show huge amounts spent on useless equipment, while millions of pounds has been spent getting out of contracts or storing the equipment at ports.
