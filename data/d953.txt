The Bees came from behind to move into the Championship automatic promotion places with an entertaining 2-1 win over in-form Bournemouth.

But he insisted the attitude, intensity and togetherness of his squad would always be underpinned by a humble approach.

"We might have gone 15 games unbeaten, but we are humble and we rely on togetherness because no team in the world will achieve anything if they are not together," said the Dane.

"This group of players have been together for one-and-a-half years now. They had a fantastic season last time and were unlucky, but they are more experienced now individually and as a group and it shows in their performances."

Frank admitted he was concerned when Bournemouth started strongly in the first 20 minutes, but was delighted with the reaction of his side.

He said: "Bournemouth were quick, moved the ball well and pressed us and we couldn't get in the game, but we showed solidity and stability and grew into it. We knew it would be a good and tight game between two good sides.

"I said at half-time that we needed to show more character and attitude if we wanted to win a game like this. After half-time we showed that - they even changed their system, so it was a good way to end the year."

He said: "We were very good and created some excellent opportunities but we didn't take the ones we had and got punished for the two defensive errors we made - that was the difference.

"It was really disappointing because we've been good defensively and for large parts we were tonight. We conceded from a corner for the first time this season and the second goal was unlike us, and that's what is frustrating."
