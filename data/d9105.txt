According to numbers supplied by the Office for National Statistics, teenagers in England who have had the Covid-19 vaccine are over three times more likely to die than teenagers who have not had the Covid-19 vaccine, which may explain why deaths among teen boys increased by 53% following the introduction of the jab to this age group in 2021.

On 20th Dec 21, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published a dataset containing details on ‘deaths by vaccination status in England’ between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21.

The dataset contains various tables showing details such as, ‘Monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for deaths involving COVID-19’, and ‘Monthly age-standardised mortality rates by vaccination status for non-COVID-19 deaths’.

What the dataset also includes is ‘age-standardised mortality rates by age-group and vaccination status for all deaths’,

What the ONS have done, is provide an age standardised mortality rate per 100,000 person-years, rather than per 100,000 population.

The reason for this is that the size of each vaccination status population has been changing all the time, due to the unvaccinated moving into the one-dose category, and the one-dose vaccinated moving into the two-dose vaccinated category throughout the year.

So by doing it this way it provides a much more accurate picture of the mortality rates because it accounts both the number of people and the amount of time a person has spent in each vaccination status.

But the ONS have inconveniently only included data on age groups over the age of 18. However, on table 9 of the ‘Deaths by Vaccination Status’ dataset, they have inadvertently provided enough details on deaths among teens aged 15-19 by vaccination status for us to calculate the mortality rates ourselves.

The ONS provide us in table 9 with both the number of deaths among teens aged 15-19, and the person-years by vaccination status. Therefore, we are able to calculate ourselves the mortality rate per 100,000 person years for 15-19 year-old teens in England by vaccination status.

According to the ONS, between 2nd January and 31st October 2021 there were 160 deaths recorded among 15-19-year-olds who had not been vaccinated, 32 deaths among teens aged 15-19 who had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 42 deaths among teens who had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine.

The ONS have calculated the person-years among unvaccinated 15-19 year-olds during this period to be 1,587,072.

To work out the mortality-rate per 100,000 person years all we need to now do is divide the person-years by 100,000, and then divide the number of deaths by the answer to that equation.

So for unvaccinated 15-19 year-olds we perform the following calculation –

Therefore, the mortality rate per 100,000 person-years among unvaccinated 15-19 year-olds is 10.09 deaths per 100,000 person-years between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21.

Now all we have to do is use the same formula to calculate the mortality rate among one-dose vaccinated and two dose vaccinated 15-19 year-olds, by using the person-years and number of deaths provided by the ONS in table 9 of their ‘Deaths by Vaccination Status’ report as shown above.

Here are the calculated mortality rates by vaccination status among 15-19-year-olds based on the ONS calculated person-years –

The ONS data shows that between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21, teenagers aged 15-19 were statistically 2 times more likely to die than unvaccinated teenagers.

But it’s the double vaccinated figures that are truly concerning.

The ONS data shows that between 1st Jan and 31st Oct 21, teenagers aged 15-19 were statistically 3 times more likely to die than unvaccinated teenagers, recording a death rate of 32.85 per 100,000 person-years.

This may explain why deaths among teenage boys aged 15-19 increased by 53% in 2021 following the introduction of the Covid-19 injection to this age-group.

The above graph has been plotted from data found within the 2020 edition of ‘Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales’, which can be downloaded here, and accessed on the ONS website here, and the 2021 edition of ‘Deaths registered weekly in England and Wales, which can be downloaded here, and accessed on the ONS website here.

The graph shows the number of deaths registered each week throughout 2020 and 2021 among teenage boys aged 15-19, and we can clearly see that from week 18 onwards in 2021 there was a noticeable rise in deaths due to all causes among teenage boys compared to 2020, with things taking a turn for the worse from week 23.

For instance in week 26, despite the Covid-19 virus allegedly wreaking havoc throughout the UK, there were just 2 deaths registered among male teens aged 15-19 in England and Wales. But fast forward one year and we can see that there were 19 deaths registered among male teens aged 15-19 in England and Wales during week 26. That represents a 850% increase.

We can also see a significant difference in week 36, where just 1 death was recorded in 2020 but 18 deaths were recorded in 2021.

The reason the increase in deaths among male teens occurring from week 18 onwards is concerning is because according to the following chart provided by the UK Health Security Agency in the Vaccine Surveillance reports, this is the point where a spike in vaccinations of 18 and 19 year-olds began, and around the same time some 16 and 17-year-olds began to be given the Covid-19 injection.

Overall, according to the ONS reports there were a total of 434 deaths due to all causes among males aged 15-19 in England and Wales between week 1 and week 52 in 2020. However, between week 1 and week 52 in 2021 there were a total of 577 deaths among males aged 15-19 in England and Wales.

But what’s concerning here is that the number of deaths between week 1 and 17 in both years are almost identical, with 170 deaths occurring in 2020, and 172 deaths occurring in 2021.

The concerning difference in deaths only occurred after the Covid-19 vaccine was introduced to this age group. With 264 deaths occurring among males aged 15-19 between week 18 and week 52 in 2020, but 405 deaths occurring among males aged 15-19 between week 18 and week 52 in 2021.

This means deaths among males aged 15-19 increased by 53% following the introduction of the Covid-19 vaccine to this age-group compared to the same period in 2020.

With ONS data showing that vaccinated teens are up to three times more likely to die than unvaccinated teens, and more ONS data showing that deaths among male teens increased by 53% in 2021 following the introduction of the Covid-19 vaccine to this age group, do you not find it extremely concerning that the NHS Covid-19 vaccination teams are now gunning for 500,000 of the nations 5 to 11 year-old children?
