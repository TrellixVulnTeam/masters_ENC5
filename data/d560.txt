Happy New Year's Eve. 2020 can't leave soon enough, though to be honest, I am a bit worried that 2021 could bring even more topsy turvies, and that's saying something. What are your plans for tonight? A bit of bubbly? Watch the ball drop in an empty Times Square? As upside down and inside out as this year has been, my three beautiful daughters with autism have kept me grounded and firmly tethered to so many of our routines. How about you? We've seen the memes and heard the jokes about autism preparing us all for lock down mode. It's true. Many of us have spent years and years staying home, altering plans, not visiting family, saying "no" to party invitations and trips here or there because of our kids needs. We're used to sacrifice. We live it. It's part of our love for our children, from tot to teen to twenty and beyond. 



In our home, the calendar is a very big deal. One of my daughters is all about the day and date and the countdown to the end of the month. December 31st is the granddaddy of countdowns - month and YEAR! Let's talk screen time. Is this a dream come true for our kids? We might as well look for the bright side. 



I'd like to thank the teachers and day programming staff who have worked so hard to keep my daughters' lives somewhat on track. We're lucky to have a snug little house with good food, better desserts and more noise than most could imagine. Someone one said that my daughters bring "joy and chaos," and while I knew it was not a compliment, I get it. I'll walk into 2021 with my eyes and ears open. Hopeful as ever, watchful and yes, doubtful too. 



Happy New Year, friends and AofA family.
