ALBANY, N.Y. — The last of five criminal investigations into allegations of sexual misconduct against former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ended on Monday with the Oswego County district attorney joining his peers in concluding that there were insufficient legal grounds to bring criminal charges.

The district attorney, Gregory S. Oakes, said in a statement that his decision was not a reflection on Virginia Limmiatis, the woman who had come forward, “or how harmful the acts she experienced were.”

Mr. Oakes’s reasoning mirrored similar language used by prosecutors in Albany, Westchester and Nassau Counties, who opened inquiries into separate allegations but declined to prosecute even though they found the women accusing Mr. Cuomo to be credible. Prosecutors in Manhattan have also closed their investigation, according to a person briefed on the matter.

Inquiries conducted by the state attorney general, Letitia James, and the State Assembly found that allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct made by multiple women were credible. Mr. Cuomo, a three-term Democrat, resigned a week after Ms. James’s report was released.
