Former President Donald Trump is reveling in the resignation of Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN.

In a statement, Trump wrote, “Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers and everybody else.”

“Now is a chance to put Fake News in the backseat because there may not be anything more important than straightening out the horrendous LameStream Media in our Country, and in the case of CNN, throughout the World. Jeff Zucker is gone—congratulations to all!” he added.

During his time in office, Trump repeatedly targeted CNN and Zucker.

Zucker said in a statement Wednesday that a “consensual relationship” with a colleague came to light as the network investigated its now-former anchor Chris Cuomo.

“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone have worked with for more than 20 years. I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began, but I didn’t. I was wrong,” Zucker said.

He added, “As a result, I am resigning today. I came to CNN on January 28, 2013. Together, we had nine great years. I certainly wish my tenure here had ended differently. But it was an amazing run. And I loved every minute. I am grateful to the thousands of incredibly talented CNN and Turner Sports employees who helped make this such a joy for me, and such a success for all of us.”

Cuomo was fired by the network last year after it was revealed that he helped his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), respond to allegations of sexual harassment.
