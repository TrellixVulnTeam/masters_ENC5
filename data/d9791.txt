In his filing, Flores asserts that his experiences interviewing with league executives shows their callous approach to abiding by the Rooney Rule.

In texts exchanged on Jan. 24, three days before Flores was set to meet Giants executives, Belichick wrote: “I hear from Buffalo & NYG that you are their guy.”

Apparently aware that Daboll, who coached with the Bills this season, was also interviewing for the Giants’ opening, Flores asked Belichick whether he was referring to Daboll or him.

Belichick then apologized. “I double checked and misread the text.”

One of Flores’s lawyers, Douglas Wigdor, said that Flores reached out to their firm the same day he received the texts from Belichick. Wigdor’s employment litigation firm has represented numerous women who accused the film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, as well as former Fox News employees in harassment and discrimination cases. The complaint was filed as a putative class action, requiring certification from the court to proceed. Wigdor said his firm was currently investigating other claims from other coaches who could be part of the potential class.

Flores is still a candidate in the open head coach searches for the Houston Texans and New Orleans Saints. Wigdor said they wanted to move forward regardless of the outcome of those interviews. “We weren’t going to wait and be coy and see if he got a job,” he said.

Flores spent 15 years as an assistant under Belichick before getting his first head coaching job, but was interviewed as a candidate for other openings before being hired in 2019 by the Dolphins, where he had a 24-25 record in three seasons.
