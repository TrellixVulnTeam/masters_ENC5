The 32-year-old has been out of the picture at Arsenal since falling out with Mikel Arteta in December, which saw him stripped of the club captaincy.

On deadline day, Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer despite having 18 months left on his contract, bringing a premature end to his Arsenal career.

Posting on social media, the striker insisted he has always been fully committed to the Gunners, which has made the manner of his departure incredibly disappointing for him.

“Thank you for making London home for myself and my family for the past four years. We went through ups and downs together and your support meant everything to me.

“Having the chance to win trophies and the honour of being the captain of this club is something I will forever keep in my heart.

“I have always been 100% focused and committed on doing everything I can for this club why is why leaving without a real goodbye hurts - but that is football.

“I’m sad I did not get the chance to help my teammates in the last few weeks, but I have nothing but respect for this club and truly wish all my guys and the fans all the best and many successful years in the future.
