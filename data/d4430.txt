Helen Flanagan sent fans wild as she shared a comical 'Insta Vs reality' video on her Instagram of herself preparing for a romantic dinner in racy underwear.

The Coronation Street favourite prompted a flurry of flame emojis as she posted the saucy video of a Valentine's Day scenario.

The first half showed Helen snacking in the kitchen while holding baby boy Charlie.

The 31-year-old mum-of-three, who is engaged to Preston North End footballer Scott Sinclair, was dressed casually in grey loungewear with her blonde hair pull back without a scrap of makeup.

The scene then switched to Helen in a lacy lingerie set with stockings and suspenders, and she completed the jaw-dropping look with a pair of bow-detail heels.

She smiled for the camera in full makeup as she carried a roast dinner to the table set with a fragrant rose and two glasses of bubbly.

Model Taylor Ward told her: "Aha this is great, u look amazing."
