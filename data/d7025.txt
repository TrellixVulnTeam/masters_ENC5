The cohort’s presence is easily felt on social media, as it was within hours after The Times contacted more than 30 donors for comment last week.

“Heads up #CuomoArmy!” one woman posted. Another accused the reporters of predatory behavior, comparing requests for comment on the Cuomo supporters’ public donations to “calling old ladies and calling for their Social Security numbers,” or sexual harassment. Another woman posted a screenshot showing that she had made a new donation to Mr. Cuomo in response.

Mr. Cuomo’s team and many of the leaders of the online movement say they do not coordinate. Several women active in Mr. Cuomo’s defense said any hint of payments or back-room-strategy sessions would undermine their credibility.

“We’ve been called fake bots or paid aides in some way,” said Anna Vavare, a former social worker and psychologist in Ontario, Canada, who runs social media for We Decide New York, Inc. “Someone suggested we are all Rich Azzopardi,” she added, referring to the political operative who was Mr. Cuomo’s spokesman as governor. “I object to that strongly. I don’t want to be him.”

But there is a clear internet-enabled feedback loop. Many of the accounts — some with names like “Italians for Cuomo” and “Cuomo News That Isn’t reported” — appear to hang on every word of Mr. Cuomo’s lawyer, Rita Glavin, echoing arguments she relays in sparsely watched public briefings that challenge the credibility of key accusers or Ms. James. And after reporters began contacting Cuomo donors, prompting several women to tweet about it, Mr. Azzopardi reached out to find out what the reporters were working on.

“There are many people who see right through the A.G.’s sham report and appreciate the decades of service the governor dedicated to the people of New York, as well as his leadership during Covid,” Mr. Azzopardi said later. “We appreciate their continued support and thank them for their friendship.”
