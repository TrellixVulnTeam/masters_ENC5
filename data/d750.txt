The FTSE 100 is ending 2020 appropriately, sliding on the last day of trading.

The market is on half-day duty today with traders able to celebrate New Year a little earlier.

Optimism which powered gains earlier this week has dissipated, with dispiriting news on vaccines rollout in the UK and the US giving traders a headache.

The index is down .86 per cent, recovering slightly from an earlier tumble of near 1.6 per cent.

A strong pound has also hit sentiment in the internationally-oriented FTSE 100. The more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 fell by 0.7 per cent in early trading.

It has been a miserable year for the FTSE and indeed the wider economy. Barring a minor miracle later today, the index will finish roughly 14 per cent down on the year.

Traders will also be assessing just how ‘frictionless’ the UK’s move to a new relationship with the European Union will actually be.

The Dax and CAC-40 were both also down, though to a lesser degree than London’s main market.
