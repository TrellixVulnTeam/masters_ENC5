Tuesday night's 02/01/22 Mega Millions jackpot is worth $20 million, with a cash-value option worth $13.7 million. The total jackpot could increase depending on the number of tickets sold around the country prior to the drawing.

The winning numbers last Friday (02/28/22) for the $421 million jackpot were: 03-16-25-44-55 with a Mega Ball of 13. The Megaplier was 3x.

There was one grand prize winner on Friday for a ticket sold in California, which reset this week's game to the $20 million minimum. It was the first winning Mega Millions grand prize won in 2022.

Additionally, there were four tickets sold that matched the first five white balls, and minus the gold Mega Ball, for the game's second prize. Three of those second-prize tickets—one each in Mississippi, New York and Texas—are worth $1 million apiece. The other ticket that was sold in Ohio is worth $3 million since they purchased the Megaplier option worth an extra $1.

There were 30 tickets sold nationwide on Friday that matched four of the five white balls plus the Mega Ball for the $10,000 third prize. Only six of those purchased the Megaplier for an extra $1, which made their third-prize winnings worth $30,000 apiece.
