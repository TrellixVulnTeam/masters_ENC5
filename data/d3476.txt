NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey said New York’s Finest have had enough of guns on the streets and the revolving door of justice.

Corey’s comments came outside of St. Patrick’s Cathedral Tuesday, as hundreds mourned slain NYPD Officer Wilbert Mora inside — in the second wake for a cop killed in the line of duty in less than one week.

“It hits very close to home,” the chief told The Post. “They’re devastated and they’re angry. They’re angry because there’s so many guns on the street and there are no consequences for people who are carrying the illegal guns.

“You’ve got career criminals in possession of illegal guns, assault rifles, high-capacity magazines,” Corey said. “They’re putting themselves in danger to go get these guns off the street, and yet the same people they are arresting are back out walking the street and all-too-often now using the guns against them. Five police officers shot in the first 21 days this year — two of them fatal.”

Mora, 27, and his 22-year-old partner, Jason Rivera, were ambushed mortally wounded during a domestic incident call in Harlem on Jan. 21.

Lashawn McNeil, 47, a career criminal shot the officers with an illegally modified 9 mm Glock 45 and had an AR-15 assault rifle stashed in the apartment, police said.

McNeil died after being shot by a third officer at the scene.

Thousands of first-responders gathered outside the historic church on Friday for Rivera’s funeral, with a similar turnout expected for Mora’s funeral on Wednesday.

Law enforcement officials have repeatedly complained about state bail reform measures that prohibit judges to set bail on misdemeanors and non-violent felonies.

Cops have also railed against lenient judges.

On Thursday, a 16-year-old aspiring rapper was released on bail after being charged with shooting and wounding another NYPD cop — even though Bronx prosecutors had asked that the reputed gang banger be held without bail.
