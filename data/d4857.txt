The investigations in California and Colorado began Monday after Harris, who had lectured in the philosophy department at UCLA, sent the email to members of the UCLA community. UCLA officials canceled classes on campus Tuesday and the university's police department tracked Harris to Boulder and reached out to law enforcement there.

Harris’ mother reached out to the woman in April, saying she had received disturbing emails from her son that mentioned the woman by name. Harris’ mother had not seen her son in five years and believed he was in need of psychiatric help.

Harris was taken into custody Tuesday morning after negotiators spoke to him by phone, Herold said. Authorities believe Harris had a connection in Boulder “but we're just not sure of the magnitude of the relationships here at this time.”

Authorities said he attempted to buy a handgun in November but his purchase was denied. Officials believe the transaction did not go through because of a California-based protection order — likely the 2021 restraining order — that said he could not purchase or possess a firearm.

Harris allegedly “began an aggressive campaign” of text messages and emails to the woman, leading her to fear for her safety. She told him to stop contacting her in March 2021 and later learned he’d made the death threats against her in the emails to his mother.

UCLA considered Harris’ threats to be credible, especially since he had been placed on “investigatory leave” the university on March 30, 2021. Those allegations ranged from “predatory behavior” to the dissemination of pornographic and violent content to students who did not have any relation to his class, court documents state.
