Deadline Day is over with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United making no significant additions to their squads.

Tottenham had a busy day, with Juventus duo Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur becoming the first signings of the Antonio Conte era, while Tanguy Ndombele completed his return to Lyon on loan, Giovani Lo Celso went to Villarreal and Dele Alli joined Everton in a dramatic late deal.

Arsenal have not added to their ranks, beyond Auston Trusty who will stay at Colorado Rapids, despite reports linking them to moves for Alvaro Morata and Alexander Isak, but did see a further departure. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joined Barcelona on a free transfer, with an announcement expected on Tuesday morning.

Ousmane Dembele was linked with both Chelsea and Manchester United in recent days, with reports suggesting a move to PSG has broken down, but will stay at Barcelona. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe is said to have decided to join Real Madrid.

Liverpool have already secured Luis Diaz, and tried to make late swoop for Fulham’s Fabio Carvalho, but could not complete the move in time.

There were no incomings as expected at Crystal Palace, though they have made Jean-Philippe Mateta’s move a permanent one. Donny van de Beek has joined Everton, while West Ham‘s hopes of re-signing Jesse Lingard are over, with Man United not willing to let him leave this month.

Newcastle have signed Brighton defender Dan Burn before the deadline but their move for Hugo Ekitike has collapsed. In the other major done deals of the day, Manchester City have landed Julian Alvarez, Rangers have signed Aaron Ramsey on loan and Christian Eriksen has joined Brentford for six months.
