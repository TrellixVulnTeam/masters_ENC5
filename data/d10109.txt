Feb. 2 (UPI) -- U.S. President Joe Biden will send 3,000 additional American troops to Eastern Europe to support NATO and Ukraine to dissuade Russia from any kind of military intervention in Ukraine, the Department of Defense announced Wednesday.

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said in a news conference that the move demonstrates America's commitment to its NATO allies. The troops will be sent to Romania, Poland and Germany.

"The current situation demands that we reinforce the deterrent and defensive posture on NATO's eastern flank," Kirby said. "President Biden has been clear that the United States will respond to the growing threat to Europe's security and stability. Our commitment to NATO Article Five and collective defense remains ironclad."

Kirby added that these troops are in addition to the prepare-to-deploy orders issued to 8,500 service members last month.
