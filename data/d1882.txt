During his fourth State of the State address on Monday in the House Chamber of the Tennessee State Capitol, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee declared, “the state of our state is strong.”

During his speech, Governor Lee presented budget and legislative priorities to a joint session of the General Assembly.

“Tennessee stands as a beacon to the rest of the country for how we can change lives when we control the size of government, prioritize efficiency, and make smart and responsible investments. I am proud to propose a budget and America at Its Best policies that reinforce freedom, innovation, exceptionalism and optimism,” Governor Lee said.

Due to Tennessee’s conservative fiscal management, the state has one of the strongest budgetary positions in history, according to the Governor. The proposed $52.6 billion budget includes strategic investments in K-12 education, higher education, improving transportation infrastructure and more.
