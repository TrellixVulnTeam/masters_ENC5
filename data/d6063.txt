A CALL The Midwife actor has shared a video of tutu-wearing nurses dancing for a young girl at Worcester's hospital.

The sweet clip shows two nurses entering the room wearing bright tutus as music from Swan Lake plays.

The six-year-old, who was undergoing chemotherapy, giggles as the nurses perform for the ballet-loving child at Worcestershire Royal Hospital.

It was filmed over two years ago but was shared by the Call The Midwife star sending it viral once again.

Stephen McGann, who plays Doctor Patrick Turner in the BBC One medical period drama, shared the video on Friday.

He wrote: "There are different Britains. I like living in this one."

The tweet was retweeted almost 6,000 times and had 63,000 likes and almost 600 comments.

At the time in October 2020, Worcestershire Acute NHS tweeted: "When Ballet-mad Izzy came into our Children's Clinic for her cancer treatment, two of the team surprised her with a very special routine...

"Huge thanks to Baylon & Emma for the lovely surprise, and well done Izzy for *literally* keeping them on their toes! #PuttingPatientsFirst."

The actor shared the post from Goodable and Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust reshared the post to Facebook.

"This adorable video from our Children's Clinic went viral again over the weekend."
