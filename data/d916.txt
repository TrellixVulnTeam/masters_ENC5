Becky Hammon became the first woman to coach a major American men’s professional sports team when she took over for San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich after he was ejected from a Wednesday game—a landmark moment that capped a breakthrough year for women in an industry dominated by men.

Hammon learned that she would be replacing Popovich when he pointed at her and uttered three words that would break a gender barrier in sports.

“You got ‘em,” he said.

“When Pop gives us an order,” Hammon said afterward “we go with it.”
