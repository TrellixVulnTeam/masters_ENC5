Modern fashion dictates its own rules. And they apply not only to clothing but also to makeup and even facial features. The moment you open Instagram, you immediately start wishing for more fashionable cheekbones, lips, and eyebrows. And guys, of course, want to grow a thick beard. But you can never know if these trends actually suit you. But thanks to modern technology, you can apply these trendy features to yourself without ever wasting your time or going under the knife.

At Bright Side, we decided to undergo a curious experiment. We gave our volunteers’ photos to our professional designers. Each photo included the participants’ specific alteration requests but the results were still quite unexpected. And in the bonus section, we totally changed the look of one of our participants.

“I want to remove the wrinkles from around my nose and lips, to make my nose a bit smaller, and to see how I look like with blue eyes. I’ve never done anything like that in reality.”

“I want my chin to be longer so that it’s proportional to my face, I want to have flawless skin, green eyes with long eyelashes, and voluminous hair of a shade 2 to 3 times lighter than my natural color.”

“I want to make my cheeks smaller so that I don’t look like a hamster. Also, I wouldn’t mind having sharper cheekbones and foxy eyes, like Bella Hadid’s.”

“I want my facial features to be softer, my nose smaller, my eyes wider, and my lashes longer and thicker.”

“I want to remove the bags from under my eyes and the wrinkles from around my nose, to have my face contour smoother, and teeth whiter. Also, I want my eyes to be green and to have curly hair. I’ve never had them in reality.”

“I don’t want to change anything now. But once, I wanted to dye my hair black. I wonder how I’d look with it.”
