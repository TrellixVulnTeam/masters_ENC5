The leaking of a sex tape featuring Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and bad boy husband Tommy Lee (of heavy metal band Mötley Crüe) was one of the defining celebrity scandals of the Nineties. It had everything: bare flesh, rock ’n’ roll and naked voyeurism. But Pam & Tommy (Disney+), an eight-part retelling of the saga, seems overwhelmed by the story’s sheer salaciousness. If agreeably riotous and often hilarious, it misses the mark dramatically.

Yet though the performances are full of sparkle – Anderson and Lee are brought rollickingly to life by Lily James and Sebastian Stan – they also lean into caricature. Anderson is portrayed as a real-life Jessica Rabbit, Lee as a crazy-eyed rocker. After a while, their company becomes exhausting.

The Anderson and Lee tape has been credited with helping popularise the internet as a mass medium. Cassettes of the couple in flagrante could only be acquired from a website and, just like that, hundreds of thousands of sweaty paws across the globe were logging on to the internet for the first time.

That those behind the tape were ahead of the technological curve is one of the series’ central messages. Seth Rogen (a co-producer) is Rand Gauthier, a porn star turned carpenter who burgled Anderson and Lee’s house after the short-fused Lee refused to pay him for his work and then put a shotgun to his face. Determined to have revenge, Gauthier absconds with Lee’s safe – containing an X-rated home movie soon to be leered at around the world.

It’s an incredible turn of events – especially considering it actually happened – with Gauthier attempting to cash in on the tape by hooking up with a porn magnate, played by Nick Offerman, before finally turning to the internet. Here the story plays out like a remake of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights – a valentine to the porn industry which, paradoxically, was released in 1997 at the height of the scandal.
