MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow is taking a “hiatus” from the network, according to a Monday report from Business Insider.

Maddow’s hiatus is expected to start Feb. 7, Business Insider reported. The break is expected to be temporary and Maddow will still appear for coverage of special events, according to the outlet.

Maddow’s reported exit will force MSNBC to fill the vacancy of her program’s primetime 9 p.m. Eastern slot, as her show pulls significantly higher ratings than the time slots before and after “The Rachel Maddow Show,” according to The Hill’s Joe Concha. MSNBC is reportedly planning on filling the vacancy with a variety of fill-in anchors, according to Business Insider.

Maddow’s movie will adapt her book and podcast “Bag Man,” with Ben Stiller reported to direct and Maddow filling the executive producer role, according to Business Insider. Maddow is also in the process of creating a new podcast.
