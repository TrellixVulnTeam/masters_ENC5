On Monday, at least seven H.B.C.U.s, including Southern University and A&M College in Baton Rouge, La., and Delaware State University in Dover, Del., received bomb threats.

At least 10 other historically Black colleges, including Spelman and Howard University in Washington, reported threats on Tuesday.

Howard also received bomb threats on Monday and on Jan. 5, when at least eight H.B.C.U.s received threats, its president, Wayne A.I. Frederick, said.

While Dr. Frederick declined to share details about the threats, he said they “definitely included language that suggested it was motivated by hate.”

One threat this week was made to the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, and the second went directly to the university’s command center, he said. Both were made over the phone.

The threats were particularly insidious considering that it is Black History Month, he said.

“The people who have come before us have experienced this, and given their lives in some circumstances, to give us the opportunity to experience this again, in a different form,” he said. “We need to respect and honor what they have had to traverse. We must stand tall in this moment as well.”

Although Morehouse College, the men’s college that neighbors Spelman, did not receive a threat, students said they were worried because of their proximity to Spelman and because of their friends there.
