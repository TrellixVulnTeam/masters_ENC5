“Each one of these people has presented the same evidence of innocence,” said Joel Flaxman, who represents several of the people whose cases were heard Tuesday. “... We’re going to be back in court on each one of the cases, and I hope that we’ll be able to convince the state’s attorney. Failing that, we will have hearings where we convince a judge of the innocence of all our clients.”
