Royal Mail has launched an investigation after sorting office staff appeared to be high on drugs after allegedly eating hash brownies from an unclaimed parcel.

Video of the incident emerged on Tuesday morning purporting to show postal workers at a delivery office in Clapham, south London, struggling to stand after consuming the cannabis-laced snacks.

One of the postal workers appeared bewildered and had to be helped with his delivery trolley. A colleague could be heard advising him: “You’re just really high.”

It had been thought that he had eaten two of the hash brownies. But he corrected a female colleague in slurred speech, saying: “I had four in all.”

A male voice can be heard saying: “I think it’s weed.”

The video showed the office had been a sent a package marked “Edibles by Pablo Chocobar”. A caption said the package had laid unclaimed for a month marked with an address from a house that was empty, it said.

It added: “So we opened em and they got handed out. They were eaten between 5.30 [and] 7.30am.”

Another caption said that one of the workers who ate the edibles “was walking to a door and thought he was walking forever”.

Royal Mail did not see the funny side of the incident and is considering disciplinary action. There were unconfirmed reports that some of the staff involved have been suspended.

In a statement a spokesperson said: “Royal Mail expects the highest standards of behaviour from our people at all times. We are taking this matter very seriously.”

It added: “We have commenced an investigation, which will determine whether any further action, including disciplinary action, might be taken. We are also reminding all staff at the delivery office of the correct procedures for dealing with items with no address for delivery or return.”

Royal Mail confirmed that no one has suffered any problems with health or wellbeing since the incident.
