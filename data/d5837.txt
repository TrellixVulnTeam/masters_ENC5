Ex PC Shareen Kashif, 30, was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment suspended for 21 months for her role in hiding a box of cash on the night police swooped to arrest her husband Kashif Mahmood.

The box has never been recovered with police admitting they will never know how much was inside.

Her husband, Kashif Mahmood, had used police cars to travel to locations where he was informed “significant quantities of criminal cash” would be exchanged by drug gangs.

He took the money, believed to be hundreds of thousands of pounds, for himself while pretending to be doing his duties.

A judge said he put the lives of drug dealers in danger from their bosses as they would be unable to explain how the money had been seized.

When officers went to arrest him in the middle of the night on April 28 2020, Kashif hid a box belonging to her husband with cash inside.

Her action came to light when investigating officers reviewed encrypted messages between the organised gang which seized at least £850,000 from criminal couriers.

When questioned following her arrest in July 2020, she admitted that she knew what her husband had been doing but had not reported him to police.

DCI Andy Taverner, who led the Met’s investigation, said: “When Kashif became an officer she swore an oath that she would behave with integrity.

“She broke that oath when she chose to interfere with our investigation by hiding her husband’s criminally-gained cash.

“[Our team’s] drive to track down corrupt officers should not be underestimated.”

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid, Professionalism, said: “Kashif knew that her actions were plain wrong.

“Her deceit and dishonesty was exposed because of the work of the Met’s Anti-Corruption Command, and directed by the IOPC.

“There is no room for corrupt officers within the Metropolitan Police Service.”
