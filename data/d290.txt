"We are piloting an expansive testing plan to give us an opportunity to reopen businesses safely and smartly. We are going to pilot the approach at the Buffalo Bills playoff game," Cuomo said on Wednesday. "The agreement with the Department of Health, the State of New York, Buffalo Bills will allowâ€¦ 6,700 fans that we social distance, masks required, but every fan will be tested before the game."

BioReference Laboratories will conduct testing before the game and fans will be required to show negative test results to be allowed inside the stadium. Post-contact tracing will also be initiated, Cuomo said.

The event will pilot an approach in which New York could safely reopen businesses, including Broadway and other large venues, before the coronavirus vaccination reaches critical mass, Cuomo added.
