…and you’ll love this one….was Cuellar investigating organized crime or investing in organized crime?

Daily Beast: Unidentified agents raided the Michigan home of a top official Tuesday morning. Vance Callender was appointed the head of Homeland Security Investigations for Michigan and Ohio, a division of ICE, in Jan. 2020 and has previously worked in law enforcement for over 25 years.

Which agency raided his home was unclear. ICE told CNBC in a statement, “As public servants working for a law enforcement agency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) takes allegations of misconduct very seriously.”

Callender has not commented on the raid. A neighbor reported seeing “about 15 plainclothes officers.”
