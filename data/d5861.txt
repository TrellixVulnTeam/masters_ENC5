The Gunners agreed a deal with the MLS side worth around £5million up front for the 27-year-old, which could rise with add-ons and also includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee.

On transfer deadline day, Arsenal announced another signing from MLS, with American defender Auston Trusty set to join from Colorado Rapids, but there has been no formal announcement of the Turner deal yet.

However, former US national team boss Arena confirmed: "If it hasn’t been fully executed, it will be.”

Centre-back Trusty was immediately loaned back to Colorado until the summer, when he will join up with the Gunners before being sent out on loan elsewhere in Europe next season to gain more experience.

Turner, meanwhile, is expected to join up with the first-team squad in the summer, allowing current No2 goalkeeper Bernd Leno to leave the club.

The German lost his place in Mikel Arteta’s side following the arrival of Aaron Ramsdale during last summer’s transfer window.
