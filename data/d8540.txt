The Ottawa City Council is struggling to cope with the Freedom Convoy that’s been occupying the city for the last several days.

City council member Diane Deans in a Zoom meeting called the truckers “mercenaries” and demanded that GoFundMe, under threat of legal action, cut off the “pipeline of funding” to the Freedom Convoy.

“We need to cut off the pipeline of funding to these…mercenaries that are unlawfully protesting and occupying our communities,” Deans said.

“I want to ask the mayor if he will pick up the phone and call GoFundMe in the states directly and demand that they cease and desist sending money to these unlawful protesters,” Deans continued, adding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should “do the same.”

“We’ve had some conversations about perhaps suing GoFundMe, but legal action takes time and this is urgent,” she added.

The shamefulness of Dean’s incendiary rhetoric of calling the truckers “mercenaries” cannot be overstated.

Deans, by definition, just called the peaceful protesters – her own constituents – professional soldiers hired by a foreign enemy.

The disturbing remarks echo a similar talking point recently made by a CBC anchor who accused the Freedom Convoy movement of being hatched by “Russian actors.”

This comes just days after Ottawa City Councillor Mathieu Fleury called for the city to launch court proceedings against GoFundMe for allowing the Freedom Convoy page to continue receiving donations.

The Freedom Convoy, with over $10 million in funding raised, is showing no signs of leaving Ottawa anytime soon, and PM Trudeau is still MIA after having fled the capital last weekend.

You can still donate to the Freedom Convoy at their GoFundMe page — for now.
