NASHVILLE — If years were musical genres, 2020 would be a country song — or maybe a blues album, or possibly gospel. It’s hard to know, in the midst of sorrow, exactly which brand of anguish is lodged in the human soul. I do know this, though: It’s been a miserable year here, a year that tore our hearts to pieces even before a bomb reduced a historic part of this city to rubble on Christmas Day.

Tornadoes ripped through Middle Tennessee last winter, killing 25 and destroying hundreds of homes and businesses. Two months later, a freak weather event called a derecho knocked out power across Nashville, in some neighborhoods for more than a week. Quarantines wrecked our tourist industry and thus much of our economy. Our public schools are still closed.

And musicians, the very heart of Music City, have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. The coronavirus has taken artists as diverse as Joe Diffie, Charley Pride and John Prine. Other musicians are wondering how they’ll pay their bills, and the people who work in the clubs, concert halls and restaurants where the musicians used to play are wondering the same thing.

And now, a bomb has gone off in the heart of our downtown.

We don’t know what caused Anthony Warner, 63, a self-employed information technology specialist and lifelong resident of Nashville’s Antioch neighborhood, to give away his car and his house and notify his clients that he was retiring. We may never know why he drove his R.V. downtown early Christmas morning, parked it near an AT&T transmission facility on Second Avenue North and then detonated the bomb it carried. All we know for sure is that Mr. Warner died in the blast.
