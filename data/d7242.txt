Boris Johnson is set to announce billions of pounds in state-backed loans to ease the cost of spiralling energy bills on families.

The Prime Minister and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, have agreed to a scheme in which taxpayers will underwrite loans to energy companies, sources told The Times. The firms will give this money back to families as a rebate.

Energy companies would then see the money returned by consumers in later years as energy prices decline.

The scheme is designed to limit the impact of the predicted energy price rise in April - expected to see the average household paying an extra £620 per year.

Government sources told The Times the proposals had been approved by ministers and would likely be announced in the next few days.

Industry sources said that energy firms could be offered up to £6 billion in loans - equivalent to a rebate of up to £200 per household.

The "rebate and clawback scheme" comes as the Prime Minister faces pressure from Tory MPs to address the cost-of-living crisis - a toxic cocktail of inflation, tax rises and high energy prices.

Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak confirmed on Sunday that they would press ahead with a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance contributions, which is expected to cost the average worker an extra £255 a year.
