Moving for better value, green space, larger homes and a more relaxed lifestyle is a booming pandemic era trend. But one group of people may hate you for it: your teenagers.

Parents planning moves with older children need good schools and easy access to local amenities, such as sports facilities, cinemas and shops â€“ places where their kids can meet friends without needing a begrudging chauffeur.

So where can you find these areas? Savills estate agents has devised a metric for house hunters with teenage children.

It analysed English local authorities in the top half of the deprivation index, which ranks areas by factors such as life expectancy.

Within this top 50pc, Savills then mapped areas according to three further factors: the availability of state secondary schools that were rated "good" or "outstanding" by Ofsted, the number of train stations for every 10,000 residents, and the journey time to a nearby town centre, either walking or by public transport.

These are the best places to buy in every region in England.
