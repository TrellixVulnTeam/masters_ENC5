On February 2, the Righteous Promise Brigades (RPB) announced that it had attacked “vital facilities” in the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Abu Dhabi, with four suicide drones.

A statement released by the group indicates that the attack was carried out in support of the Houthis (Ansar Allah) in Yemen, where forces backed by the UAE escalated their military operations recently.

So far, there have been no reports in the media about any attacks on the UAE. The country is yet to officially confirm or deny the claims made by the group.

The RPB, which presents itself as a force native of the Arabian Peninsula, is reportedly backed by Iran and based in Iraq.

On 23 January of last year, the mysterious group attacked the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with a number of suicide drones. The attack targeted several positions including the Al Yamamah Palace, the official residence and office of the King of Saudi Arabia and the seat of the royal court.

Four days after the drone strike on Riyadh, the RPB released a poster showing a drone attacking Burj Khalifa in the Emirate of Dubai.

If confirmed, the RPB drone strike will be the second attack to target the UAE in less than three days. On January 31, the Houthis launched a number of ballistic missiles and suicide drones at targets in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

The US is already moving to support the UAE, where it maintains a large military presence. According to recent reports, Washington will soon deploy a guided-missile destroyer and fifth-generation fighter jets to the country. It is worth noting that American missile defense systems are already deployed there.
