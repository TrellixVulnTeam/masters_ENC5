PUSSYCAT Dolls star Ashley Roberts keeps things together as she wears a plunging pink blazer with matching trousers on a night out.

The singer, 40, sparkled at a screening of Disney+’s Pam & Tommy in London on Monday.

Fellow Doll Kimberly Wyatt, 39, took time out from Dancing On Ice rehearsals to join her, right.

Pink’s a colour that clearly suits Kimberly too.

Last week Ashley revealed her schedule was so intense in the Pussycat Dolls that she was rushed to hospital over fears she was having a brain aneurysm.

The singer was made to work so much that her body started “shutting down” and she had to have an MRI scan - then contracted viral arthritis.

Speaking about the horror impact on her body of her time in the chart-topping group, Ashley said: “The thing was, being in a girl band, we make people a lot of money so there was, the schedule was outrageous.

“I’m not going to lie, by the end I was breaking down. I was in the hospital.

“They thought I was having a brain aneurysm. I think it was just from going, going, going and my body was just shutting down really.

“I remember being in the hospital, I was actually here in London, and I was like, ‘I’ve got to go to Germany, I’ve got to get on a plane now’. I was like, ‘I’ve got a show to do.'

“As I was walking to get the MRI because they thought I was having a brain aneurysm, my knee locked up and I got this viral arthritis so I couldn’t bend my knee.

“The doctor was like, ‘I think you need to just rest’. It’s wild.”
