(OPINION) Have you ever watched an abortion? The thought might conjure images of surgical tools or the dull shade of a hospital gown, but ending a pregnancy can be as simple as swallowing a prescription.

That was the point Jex Blackmore, a Detroit activist, and artist, wanted to illustrate when she ingested a mail-order abortion pill during a live interview with Fox 2′s Charlie Langton on Sunday, she said to end a pregnancy. Jex Blackmore appeared on Fox 2 News Detroit‘s ‘Let It Rip’ segment on Sunday to discuss the Food and Drug Administration’s decision last month to allow abortion pills to be prescribed via telehealth and mailed to patients.

Host Charlie Langton, 61, moderated the debate between Blackmore and Rebecca Kiessling, 52, a pro-life campaigner and lawyer. ‘They’re incredibly safe,’ Blackmore said of the pills, while explaining how the mail-order system works. ‘It is extremely easy and private and allows you to really self-manage your abortion.’

The activist then held up a white pill, claiming it was mifepristone, a progesterone blocker that stops the growth of a pregnancy that is less than 10 weeks along. Blackmore explained mifepristone was the first of two pills that a person would take to terminate a pregnancy. The second, misoprostol, causes cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus. ‘I want to show you how easy it is, and safe it is, by taking it myself,’ she said before putting it in her mouth, washing it down with a sip of water, and smiling at the camera. A stunned Langton could barely get his words out when he asked: ‘You’re not pregnant, are you?’ ‘I would say that this is going to end a pregnancy,’ Blackmore replied. ‘This would be my third abortion.’ Kiessling closed her eyes and shook her head in response before arguing against the pill, saying there is ‘no dignitary in it.’
