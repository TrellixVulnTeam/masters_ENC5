Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) has revealed to Daisy Midgley (Charlotte Jordan) he did in fact push Max Turner (Paddy Bever) down the stairs in Coronation Street.

After finding Max trashing his flat during last night’s episode, Daniel pushed him out of the door, causing him to tumble down the stairs.

Investigated by the police, Daniel spun a web of lies, telling everyone Max fell.

However, he was left fearful when a detective arrived and told him Max remembers being pushed down the stairs.

In fact, after Mrs Crawshaw revealed she believes Daniel, she told him to apply for a full-time teaching role at the end of his placement.

As Daniel’s mood was lifted, he kissed Daisy again and later made the decision to end his relationship with Lydia (Rebecca Ryan).

Sharing a moment with Daisy, Daniel thought it would be the perfect opportunity to tell her the truth about Max’s fall.

Daisy immediately left, shocked at Daniel’s lies and the fact he was capable of something so horrible.
