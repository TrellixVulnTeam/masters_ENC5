Animals at Great Pets were routinely—and sometimes fatally—denied adequate veterinary care.

Two traumatized cockatiel chicks died after the facility’s owner rammed a gavage needle down their throat in a crude attempt to empty their apparently impacted or infected crop—the pouch at the base of a bird’s esophagus where food is temporarily stored—and flipped them upside down until they regurgitated. He admitted that this was “very hard on the birds” and said that a veterinarian he knew refused to perform the dangerous procedure, which could easily cause the birds to inhale their own vomit and die.

A worker left two apparently paralyzed newborn guinea pig pups without any care overnight, and one died. His littermate suffered for hours and was finally euthanized.

Early one morning, the same worker found that a mother guinea pig was in distress and breathing rapidly but failed to notify a veterinarian, who was on site, of her poor condition, and she died that afternoon. The next morning, her pup was cold, lethargic, and breathing heavily, but the worker failed to take him for emergency care, and he died, too.
