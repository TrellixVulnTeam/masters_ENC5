ead Kolasinac is closing in on a loan move to his former club Schalke, with Arsenal set to pay a portion of his wages.

Kolasinac has made just one Premier League appearance for Arsenal this season, with the majority of the Bosnia international’s games coming in Mikel Arteta’s rotated Europa League side for the group stages.

It is understood that Kolasinac had been willing to fight for his place at Arsenal, but if he was to leave he always wanted to go back to Germany.

Kolasinac was close to a move to Bayer Leverkusen in the summer, but looks set to rejoin Schalke, the club where he began his career and made 94 appearances before joining Arsenal in 2017.

Kieran Tierney, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Bukayo Saka have all been preferred to Kolasinac down the left flank this season, with his last appearance coming in the 4-1 Carabao Cup home loss to Manchester City on 22 December.

Kolasinac’s departure frees up a non-homegrown spot in Arteta’s Europa League squad, which could be filled by Gabriel Martinelli after the striker was initially left out while he was recovering from a knee injury.
