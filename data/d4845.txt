One of the best of the bunch (in our opinion) is the iRobot Roomba i7+. Typically listed for $859.99, this feature-packed Roomba is now selling at Amazon $799.99, a $60 price cut. The i7+ wowed us with its ability to self-empty collected dirt and debris into its included dirt tower/charging station and the way it creates virtual maps that can track cleaning cycles and even keep it out of individual rooms.

If you're on a budget, consider the Eufy 11S, on sale at Amazon for $158.22. This sleek model is typically listed from $199.99, but you can get it for 21% off with the current $11.77 price cut and the additional $30 coupon on the product page. The 11S is our favorite affordable robot vacuum for its ability to pick up more dirt per run (11.6 grams, specifically) than more expensive models from other manufacturers. If you want to clean your floors while working from home or watching your favorite shows, the 11S runs quietly as it goes around and even underneath furniture.
