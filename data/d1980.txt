MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A man and woman have been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal drive-by shooting of a 7-year-old boy on the Fourth of July, prosecutors said.

Jordan Pittman, 19, and Angieline Kennedy, 21, also have been indicted on charges of attempted first-degree murder after two women were critically wounded in the shooting that killed Kelby Shorty.

Family members said the boy had just finished watching fireworks with other children when shots rang out in a Memphis neighborhood.

Witnesses said a passenger got out of a car, shouted something, and began shooting a handgun, the Shelby County district attorney's office said in a statement Monday.

Kelby was shot and he died on the scene. A 29-year-old woman and a 22-year-old woman also were shot.

Andrea Willis, a relative of Kelby’s, told WMC-TV that he was a “sweet little boy” who liked to play football, and eat hot chips and honey buns.

Kennedy's lawyer said Kennedy is fighting the charges, Pittman's lawyer did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
