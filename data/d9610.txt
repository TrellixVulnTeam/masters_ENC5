Four men have been charged in the overdose death of actor Michael K Williams, a federal prosecutor said on Wednesday.

US attorney Damian Williams and the New York City police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said the four were charged in criminal complaints unsealed on Tuesday and Wednesday in Manhattan federal court in a narcotics conspiracy alleging their involvement in the distribution of fentanyl-laced heroin that resulted in the death of Williams, who was best known for playing Omar Little on The Wire.

They allege that one of the men charged, named as Irvin Cartagena, sold the deadly dose of drugs to Williams

New York City’s medical examiner earlier ruled that Williams, 54, died of acute drug intoxication on 6 September. He was found dead by family members in his penthouse apartment. At that time, the medical examiner’s office ruled Williams’s death an accident.

“Michael K Williams, a prominent actor and producer, tragically overdosed in his New York City apartment from fentanyl-laced heroin,” Damian Williams said in a press release.

“Today, along with our law enforcement partners at the NYPD, we announce the arrests of members of a drug crew, including Irvin Cartagena, the man who we allege sold the deadly dose of drugs to Michael K Williams. This is a public health crisis. And it has to stop.”
