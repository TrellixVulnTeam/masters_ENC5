A recipe dating to at least the 16th century, it’s considered the national soup of Scotland, ladled up for St. Andrew’s Day, Hogmanay and Burns Night.

The most minimalist recipes call for a rich chicken broth thickly strewn with slices of leek and chunks of the stewed bird, without so much as a parsley sprig or carrot slice decorating the bowl. More elaborate incarnations include beef broth or meat, rice or oatmeal, and — a typically medieval addition — prunes or raisins.

Writing in the early 19th century, under the pen name Margaret Dods, Christian Isobel Johnstone had a cock-a-leekie recipe in “The Cook and Housewife’s Manual” that includes capon, beef shin, optional oatmeal and plenty of leeks, “boiled down into the soup till it becomes a green lubricious compound.”
