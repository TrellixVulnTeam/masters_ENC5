A COUPLE has revealed that their whole family shares a bed - and even their 11-year-old daughter beds down with them.

Brandon and Megan Deal are parents to daughters Kenzi and Sarah, sharing updates about family life on the dad’s TikTok account.

And the 30-year-old dad recently shared a video of the family’s sleeping arrangements, which has amassed almost four million views.

In the video, Brandon can be seen signing goodnight to his 11-year-old daughter Kenzi, who is deaf.

Moments later she admits that she doesn’t ‘feel safe’ in her bed, and instead clambers in between her mum and her dad where her younger sister Sarah is already nestled in.

Captioning his video, Brandon adds: “And I’m OK with that!”

The video has received a very mixed response, with many baffled as to why the children don’t sleep in their own beds.

“Too old to co-sleep,” wrote one, with another agreeing, adding, “Wait you guys still saying it’s normal to co-sleep after 7-8 years old?”

However, there were plenty of viewers who were entirely supportive of the family’s decision to sleep together.

One wrote: “Your parents are supposed to make you feel safe - there’s literally nothing wrong with co-sleeping.”

Another agreed, commenting: “Each family dynamic is different, kids are happy and healthy and loved, game over trolls.”
