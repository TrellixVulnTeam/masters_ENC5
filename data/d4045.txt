A woman who wanted a Marvel character tattoo has been left mortified that it looks like a penis.

Courtney Lyn wanted a tattoo of Rocket the raccoon, a fictional character from the Marvel movie Guardians of the Galaxy, on her arm.

However, she was horrified after realising part of the design looked more phallic than intended, DailyStar reports.

She shared the video on TikTok, which has been viewed more than two million times, leaving many in stitches.

The woman said in the video: "It was supposed to be a knee cap. But it doesn't look like a knee cap, it looks like a penis!"

She then shows the whole tattoo, showing Rocket holding a laser cannon while seemingly kneeling on the ground.

Courtney showed off the reference photo, adding: "Look at this knee cap in question, there is a line there.

"He (tattoo artist) followed it correctly, unfortunately. I don't know if that's a fold in the clothing, a crack in the knee pad or whatever, but he followed it.

"I don't want to correct someone who does it professionally.

"But if I saw that from an artist's standpoint, I would probably think, 'Hmmm I’m not going to do that.'

"Or, as some of you have suggested, do some shading."

She also said the tattoo artist had worked on her previously – adding she was watching him doing the inking the whole time.

However, it wasn't until she went back home and saw the tattoo in the mirror that she saw it for what it was.

Many TikTokers giggled as they made the same realisation.

One commented said: "It's only missing the veins."

Another wrote: "They most likely did that on purpose. Whose knee cap looks like that?"

Some asked Courtney to make sure the tattoo artist covered the stroke up when she goes back for the finishing touches.

Courtney said: "I'm getting it coloured in, I'm finding a different tattoo artist, and no I'm not giving him (Rocket) legs, he will be on his knees, and I will not be doing it red."
