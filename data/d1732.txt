Sometimes you just have to stand back and applaud.

That's the view of James Milner on team-mate Mo Salah's sensational form in front of goal.

The England veteran - who turned 36 last month - said even he can't believe his eyes at times when Salah finds the net.

He said: "​​For me, the last few months, if he's not, there is someone playing very, very well in front of him.

"For me, he is right up there – the goals he's scoring, the numbers he's putting up consistently, goals and assists.

"Obviously I might be slightly biased – and I'm blessed as well because I get to train with him every day and see how good he is in training as well – but I think he has to be the best over the recent months and hopefully long may it continue.

"He's special. Some of the goals he's scoring at times, you just have to stop and applaud them really."
