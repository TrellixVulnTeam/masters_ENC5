The Chinese city will make history by becoming the first host of both Summer and Winter Olympics, having staged the latter only 14 years ago.

The iconic Bird’s Nest Stadium which hosted the opening and closing ceremonies in 2008 will do so again this time around.

In total, the Games will feature 109 events across 15 disciplines in seven different sports, including seven events which will see their first ever Olympic champions crowned.

Today (Tuesday, February 2) the BBC’s coverage is on the iPlayer and BBC Sport website from 12:00pm to 2:05pm GMT. Eurosport 1 have coverage from 1pm.

What time will the Beijing Winter Olympics be on in the UK?

As with Tokyo last summer, Beijing is eight hours ahead of the UK, meaning British fans face late nights and early starts if they fancy catching the action live.

Most days, the sport will start soon after midnight GMT and will usually be wrapped up by about 3pm.

Which TV channels will be showing the Olympics in the UK?

In the UK, the Games will be shared between free-to-air coverage on the BBC and subscription channel Eurosport.

The former will show more than 300 hours of action across BBC One and BBC Two, while Eurosport will offer even more extensive coverage.

How can I stream the Olympics online?

TV licence fee-payers can stream the action for free on the BBC website and via the BBC iPlayer app, with the broadcaster offering additional streams to its TV coverage.

Eurosport subscribers can stream the action online or via the Eurosport Player app, while Discovery+ will offer every moment from every event streamed live.
