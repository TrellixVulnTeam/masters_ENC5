TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) â€” A north-central Kansas lawmaker has been arrested in Topeka on suspicion of drunken driving.

Topeka police said Tuesday that officers stopped Republican Rep. Suzi Carlson, of Clay Center, at about 9 p.m. Monday a few blocks south and west of the Statehouse. They said testing showed that Carlson was operating her vehicle under the influence of alcohol, though they were not specific about the type of testing.

An online log shows that Carlson, 69, was booked into the Shawnee County jail at 11 p.m. on suspicion of DUI and making an unsafe lane change. She was released on $1,000 bond at about 2:15 a.m. Tuesday, the record showed.

She is scheduled to make an appearance March 1 in Shawnee County District Court.

Carlson was not available at the Statehouse and did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages seeking comment.

She is a retired municipal judge who has served in the House since 2019. She is a member of its Agriculture, Water and Health and Human Services committees.
