White House press secretary Jen Psaki accused Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and other conservatives of “parroting Russian talking points” amid the looming threat of conflict between Russia and Ukraine, The Hill reports.

Said Psaki: “If you are digesting Russian misinformation and parroting Russian talking points you are not aligned with longstanding bipartisan American values, which is to stand up for the sovereignty of countries like Ukraine, but others.”
