The 31-year-old was forced off with injury in the quarter-final win over Morocco, and Egypt confirmed in a statement that he will play no further part in the tournament.

The statement read: “The x-rays conducted by Ahmed Hegazi, the national team player, showed that his injury is a rupture of the connective muscle tendons that requires treatment in a specialised centre, which means that he is unable to complete the tournament that ends on Sunday.”

There are also issues in goal for Egypt to deal with ahead of the last-four clash.

First-choice goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy came off against Ivory Coast with a hamstring injury, with Gabaski coming on and helping Egypt to win the penalty shootout.

But Gabaski himself picked up an injury against Morocco, as third-choice Mohamed Sobhi replaced him in extra-time.

It means El Shenawy and Gabaski are both doubts for the Cameroon match and Egypt may well have to put their faith in Sobhi.

There is more certainty up front, where Mohamed Salah will once again be the key man. He scored one and assisted another against Morocco, and his country will need him to step up again if they are to get the better of hosts Cameroon.
