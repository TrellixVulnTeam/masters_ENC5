Actor Sharon Stone suggested another disclaimer that Joe Rogan should add to his hugely popular podcast, following rising controversy over his show’s misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines.

“He should put a disclaimer that he’s an asshole and that his behavior is dangerous,” Stone told TMZ on Tuesday. “COVID is not an opinion-based situation,” she added, accusing Rogan of “risking people’s lives with his idiocy.”

Stone’s “adopted grandmother” Eileen Mitzman died after contracting the coronavirus. The actor’s sister meanwhile was hospitalized.

Amid mounting scrutiny, Rogan on Sunday offered an apology of sorts for any offense caused by his show. Spotify said it would add a content advisory to his podcasts talking about the pandemic.

On Monday, though, Rogan tweeted and then deleted an incorrect story about treating the virus.
