ARGENTINA star Emiliano Martinez left fans in hysterics after celebrating in the background of an interview with Colombia's losing keeper.

The 29-year-old received the man of the match award as he guided his national team to a 1-0 victory over their South American rivals in the World Cup qualifier.

And after the match the Aston Villa No1 could be seen parading the award around the pitch as he enjoyed the moment with the fans.

Unfortunately, however, he accidentally came into shot during Colombia keeper Camilo Vargas' post-match interview.

But that didn't stop Villa fans from loving Martinez's antics after the final whistle as they described just how much they adore their player.

One Villa fan said: "Not enough words in the dictionary to describe my love for that man."

Another added: "Even when he’s not trying, his s**thousery is off the scale!

"Extending his contract was the best business we did during the window."

And a third Villa supporter: "I bloody love him. What a character."

This is not the first time Martinez has been known for his rather inflammatory antics.

In a game against Manchester United earlier on in the season, he confronted Cristiano Ronaldo by insisting he take the Red Devils' late penalty.

Bruno Fernandes stepped up instead and blasted his effort over the bar.

Martinez then turned to face the Man Utd fans and celebrated directly in front of them at Old Trafford.

Meanwhile, Argentina had already booked their place in Qatar prior to their win over Colombia.

But Colombia look set to miss out on the finals following the loss to Martinez and Co.

They currently sit seventh in the South American table, four points adrift of the fourth and final qualification spot.

Colombia have reached the last two World Cups, reaching the quarter-finals in 2014 and last 16 in 2018.
