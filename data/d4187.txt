The highly transmissible Omicron variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus now accounts for nearly all of the coronavirus infections globally.

In its weekly epidemiological update today, the World Health Organization said that the Omicron variant, which accounts for over 93% of all coronavirus specimens collected in the past month, counts several sub-lineages: BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3.

BA.1 and BA.1.1 – the first versions identified – still account for over 96% of all the sequenced Omicron cases submitted to the public virus tracking database GISAID, but in parts of Europe and Asia, BA.2, sometimes known as a “stealth” subvariant, is starting to outcompete BA.1.

“BA.2-designated sequences have been submitted to GISAID from 57 countries to date,” WHO said on Tuesday. It added that in some countries, the sub-variant now accounted for more than half of all sequenced Omicron cases.

The UN health agency said little was known yet about the differences between the sub-variants but several studies have suggested that BA.2 is more infectious than the original sub-lineage.

WHO expert Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters that information about BA.2 was very limited, but that some initial data indicated it had “a slight increase in growth rate over BA.1.”

Omicron is generally known to cause less severe disease than previous Covid variants like Delta, and Van Kerkhove said there so far was “no indication that there is a change in severity” in the BA.2 sub-variant.
