"Mamma Mia!" headlines the Sun, referring to the Metropolitan Police probe into an event at the Downing Street flat, which reportedly saw Abba songs being played loudly on the night Dominic Cummings left his role as chief adviser. The paper also criticises Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs, arguing they became so "demented by rage" that their attacks on the PM in the Commons fell flat. However, the Sun adds it thinks Mr Johnson also lost the plot.
