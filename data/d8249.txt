The Blues lifted the trophy in 2020 and 2021, and will have the chance to extend that run when they play either Tottenham or Manchester City in next month’s final. They will find out who their opponents will be on Thursday night.

Pernille Harder and Jessie Fleming put Chelsea 2-0 up at Kingsmeadow and although United’s Vilde Boe Risa reduced the deficit, Jess Carter struck their third before the break.

The visitors then had to play the final 13 minutes with ten players after goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley was shown a straight red card for her challenge on Blues substitute Sam Kerr outside the box.

Chelsea started the better side and they got their reward when Harder scored a fine individual goal to break the deadlock in the 26th minute. Just five minutes later, the unmarked Fleming looped a header over Baggaley to double the lead.

The visitors responded immediately when Norway midfielder Boe Risa fired home inside the near post 60 seconds later, as United looked to get themselves straight back into the match.

But Chelsea regained their two-goal advantage before the break, with Carter bursting into the area to finish.

United threatened on several occasions at set-pieces in the second half, but the Blues held firm to extend their unbeaten run this year to five matches.
