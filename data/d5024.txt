Well, it has only taken a few years to find a new name for the former Washington Redskins.

Apparently choosing a name that isn’t ‘offensive’ is a long and arduous process.

NFL Hall of Famer Joe Theismann may have confirmed the new name in a radio interview.

The team could be known as the Washington Commanders according to Theismann.

Surly, it will only be a matter of time before this name too is considered offensive.

For now, social media is mocking the name by calling the team the “Washington Commies.”

Maybe they should have just stuck with the Washington Football Team.

Here’s more on the likely new name from the New York Post:

The former star quarterback for Washington — and current Ring of Honor member of the NFL franchise — sounded awfully confident in a radio interview Monday that the new name of the team would be the Washington Commanders. A few hours later, when his inadvertent announcement was going viral, he stated he did not know what the name would be. It is unclear whether Theismann was confirming a tweet that suggested the Washington Football Team would be named the Commanders or whether he was assuming the viral tweet was correct.

So far, early reaction to the potential name change hasn’t been great…

The NFL is in a no win situation here for sure.

“Washington Commies” has picked up steam on Twitter.
