Feb. 1 (UPI) -- The NFL's Denver Broncos are officially listed on the market and likely will have the highest price tag in North American sports history.

The sale of the team was announced Tuesday by the Pat Bowlen Trust, which has managed the organization since Bowlen -- who died in 2019 -- stepped away from day-to-day operations of the club in 2014 due to the early onset of Alzheimer's disease. The Broncos are valued at just under $4 billion.
