NBC's "Late Night" premiered 40 years ago, when David Letterman — coming off a short-lived NBC morning show — moved into the hour after Johnny Carson on "The Tonight Show."

Letterman will be returning to the show this week to mark that anniversary, joining current host Seth Meyers, who is only the fourth host in the program's four-decade history.

When Letterman left to join CBS in 1993, NBC passed the baton to a then-unknown comedy writer named Conan O'Brien. O'Brien occupied that seat longer than anyone else, leaving in 2009 to take over "The Tonight Show" (although not for long). Jimmy Fallon stepped in for the next five years before replacing Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show," giving way to Meyers, who like Fallon was another "Saturday Night Live" veteran.

Here's a look back at some memorable moments featuring each of those hosts.
