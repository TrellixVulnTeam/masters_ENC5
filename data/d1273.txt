A PROLIFIC Southampton shoplifter has been jailed for 11 offences – with the stolen items totalling £5,886.

Thomas Amos, 35, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to a spate of thefts at WestQuay, which took place in a six week period between November 23 and January 6.

He was sentenced to two years in prison, and has also been handed Criminal Behaviour Order, banning him from entering the city centre as shown in the map for three years.

Breaching this carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years.

PCSO Jack Kemp said: “Amos was one of the most prolific shoplifters in the city centre and we hope this sentence demonstrates to businesses how seriously we take shoplifting.

“It also sends a clear message to any shoplifters out there: continue to steal and you will also end up in court.

“We will continue to work hard to make Southampton a safer and more pleasant place for residents and visitors, and criminal behaviour orders are one important way we can help achieve this.

“Please continue to report instances of shoplifting to us, and other crimes like antisocial behaviour, as they help us build a strong case to get these orders in place.”

Between November 24 and January 4, Amos also breached a restraining order prohibiting him from entering John Lewis.
