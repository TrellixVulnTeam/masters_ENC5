Joe Biden’s administration is investigating why foreigners enter the United States unlawfully.

President Biden believes the best way to reduce illegal immigration is to identify why individuals leave their home country.

“There is a whole lot of illegal movement but there is also a way to begin to deal with the reason they are leaving in the first place,” he said in a statement.

Department of State representatives are holding talks with counterparts from border countries to “figure out” what challenges illegal aliens face before leaving.

“We are working a lot with the neighboring countries [and have] a lot to do, there is a lot,” Biden said. “We [need to] figure out why they are leaving in the first place.”

The President claimed illegal immigrants must have a good reason for selling all of their belongings, paying smugglers, and risking their lives in extreme weather conditions to start a new life in the United States.

“It is not like people sit around and say in Guadalajara, ‘I got a great idea,'” he said. Adding, “Let us sell everything we have, give it to a coyote to take us across the border and leave us in the desert in a country that does not want us where we do not speak the language. Wouldn’t that be fun?.”

The department’s findings will be used to revise immigration policy and better address illegal alien concerns.

Biden is staying tight-lipped about exactly what steps Washington might take to reduce illegal immigration.

“One of the fundamental things we have got to do in addition to some of the changes we will make—we will not get into it today,” he said.
