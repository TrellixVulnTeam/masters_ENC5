This is from prime minister of Quebec, 129 shares and 85k views. From 16 hours ago.

Facebook is deliberately not showing the real view on videos of opposite narrative to make it look smaller than it actually is. For example here, if we go with a rule of three (and considering how massive the trucker’s movement is right now), the video on the left should have around 9.6 million views considering the number of shares it has. I’ve seen a lot of these (heavily shared videos with minimal views) appear lately on my feed. Are we finally having a real conspiracy?
