Children’s Health Defense asks that you help us hold those accountable who have failed the American people when it comes to public health and pandemic management. Take action by completing our action alert to send letters to your elected representatives demanding that Fauci be officially investigated by Congress. This action is long overdue. New evidence surfaced weeks ago suggesting that Fauci lied to Congress. On January 14th, we issued an action alert with a letter that can be sent to your federally elected officials requesting they launch an immediate investigation of ‘America’s Doctor.’ In a January 11, 2022 letter to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra from James Comer, ranking member of the Committee on Government Oversight and Reform, and Jim Jordan, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the Congressmen asked for a “transcribed interview” of Dr. Fauci. The letter to Becerra includes government emails, made public for the first time, indicating that Dr. Fauci was aware of the potential that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the possibility that the virus was intentionally genetically manipulated. Additionally, on January 10, 2022, Project Veritas announced it had uncovered new government documents verifying that the EcoHealth Alliance approached the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in March, 2018 seeking funding to conduct gain of function research of bat-borne coronaviruses. DARPA rejected the proposal over safety concerns and because it violated the gain of function research moratorium. An official Congressional investigation of Dr. Fauci is long overdue. Fauci orchestrated the disastrous American response to the COVID crisis with the U.S. racking up 20% of the world’s COVID deaths despite having only 4.2% of the global population. Use the form below to contact your elected officials in Washington, D.C. today to urge immediate action in launching an investigation of Dr. Anthony Fauci.
