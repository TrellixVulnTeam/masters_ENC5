According to the complaint, Vindman is seeking unspecified compensation “for the injuries he suffered as a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct,” as well as other punitive damages and legal fees. Vindman alleges that he and his family suffered “significant reputational, emotional and financial harm” because of Trump and his allies’ actions, as well as from the public attacks. The attacks on his service and loyalty to the United States also prevented him from pursuing the kind of career for which he had expertise, he alleges.
