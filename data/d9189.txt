The British government spent £12.1 billion ($16.3 billion) on personal protective equipment (PPE) as the Covid-19 pandemic raged between March 2020 and March 2021. However, £8.7 billion of this splurge has since been written off as a loss, due to defective and unsuitable equipment, and the government buying at above-market prices."Most of these items were bought at speed early in the pandemic, at a time when there was a surge in demand in other countries and a temporary decline in global supply," the report states.Overpaying was not the government's only blunder.When the equipment finally reached its users, not everything was up to scratch.In total, £8.7 billion of the £12.1 billion spent from taxpayer funds is now considered a loss. The government is expected to lose another £1.23 billion on orders fulfilled after March 2021 that could not be cancelled beforehand.The true extent of the losses may be greater, as the report notes that the government has "incomplete records of the PPE... it had purchased, what had been used and the location, condition and quality of the remaining items." While the report states that "some progress has been made" in rectifying the issue, "significant weaknesses and gaps in the Department's inventory records remain."A Department of Health spokesperson told ITV that "the supply of these vital items helped keep our NHS open at a moment of national crisis," adding that the government is "seeking to recover costs from suppliers wherever possible." However, opposition parties have pointed to the report in criticizing Boris Johnson's Conservative government.Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the waste as "shocking and inexcusable," while Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said "with billions being lost to fraudsters, and now this, it's plain to see that this Tory government cannot be trusted with our money," apparently referring to the fraudulent use of Covid loan schemes.
