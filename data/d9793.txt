Since the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, reporters and the specially appointed House Jan. 6 committee have been trying to achieve a clearer picture of the steps that President Donald J. Trump and his allies took to try to keep him in power and overturn the 2020 election.

A portrait of different plans has emerged: baseless claims made in lawsuits about voter fraud, a plot to create a separate set of electors for the Electoral College and a pressure campaign on Vice President Mike Pence to pick his own president.

One of the biggest questions, however, has been how far was Mr. Trump willing to go in using the apparatus of the federal government to stay in power?

The Times has uncovered that in the weeks after Joseph R. Biden Jr.â€™s victory, Mr. Trump considered using the levers of the federal government to seize voting machines in swing states.
