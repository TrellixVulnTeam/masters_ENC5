The U.S. Army announced it will immediately begin separating soldiers from the service who refused the COVID-19 jabs.

The discharge order is the latest U.S. military branch to remove service members who refused to be guinea pigs in a Big Pharma experiment.

While most active troops have received at least one dose, some individuals stuck to their principles by refusing the experimental injection.

Under a directive issued by Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth, commanders are to initiate involuntary administrative separation proceedings against any Soldier who has refused the COVID-19 vaccination order and does not have an approved or pending exemption request. The order applies to regular Army Soldiers, reserve-component Soldiers serving on Title 10 active-duty, and cadets. “Army readiness depends on Soldiers who are prepared to train, deploy, fight and win our nation’s wars,” said Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth. “Unvaccinated Soldiers present risk to the force and jeopardize readiness. We will begin involuntary separation proceedings for Soldiers who refuse the vaccine order and are not pending a final decision on an exemption.”

Service members who refuse the COVID-19 inoculation order won’t be eligible for involuntary separation pay and may be subject to recoupment of any unearned special or incentive pays.

Soldiers who complete their separation or retirement, or begin transition leave, on or before July 1, 2022, will be granted a temporary exemption and will be permitted to complete their separations or retirements.

For unvaccinated soldiers who received denials for religious or medical accommodation requests, the U.S. Army states they must complete one of the following within seven calendar days or face separation proceedings:
