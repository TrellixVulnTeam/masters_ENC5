ebruary – the month of romance – gets the beauty world creative far beyond pink hues and heart-shaped cosmetics. The brands that have caught our attention know the secret to our love is not through gimmicks but supercharged skincare, new brands, sustainable alternatives and high-fashion masking.

In our monthly Let’s Make-Up round-up, we bring you a selection of the tried and tested, freshest, and buzziest beauty launches that are worth adding to your basket. All types of lotions and potions across makeup, skincare, haircare and more cross our desks and we take it upon ourselves to review them all so you don’t have to. If we include it below, then you know it’s a good ‘un.

This month’s new launches are all about soothing skin, beautiful scents and smart anti-ageing. There’s been great innovation with the latter in terms of ingredient formulation from Murad, Clinique, Trilogy and Dr Dennis Gross.

Makeup is back and with the help of KVD Beauty and lash lengthening heroes from No7 and Avon, we can start refilling our post-Omicron diaries - while looking and feeling our best selves with a radiance boost from Fenty Skin, Dior and a spritz or two from new fragrances at both Boy Smells and Viktor & Rolf.

Self-care is still very much on the agenda and influencer Estée Lalonde is on hand with her mindful lifestyle launch filled with bath and body heroes. Fresh to UK shores, BYOMA and OWAY are simplifying our skin and hair routines respectively (the latter of which have a sustainability from soil to our beauty cabinets).

For all this and more besides, see our edit of the hottest beauty drops you need on your radar.
