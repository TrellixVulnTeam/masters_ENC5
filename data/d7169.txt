OVER the last few years, we have spoken a lot about the dangers of visiting sun beds. Not only do they increase the risk of melanoma but they can also lead to premature ageing.

However, one woman has found herself in the middle of an online debate, after sharing a video on TikTok of her transformation.

After educating herself on the high risks of tanning, the rising social media star, Kayla, made the decision to cut sun beds out from her beauty routine.

Instead, she began to invest in an intense daily skincare routine with various products.

However, despite the efforts to improve the damage, online trolls have claimed the effects are reverse - and instead of having a more youthful look, Kayla now appears a decade older.

''How the hell did you get older by 30 years,'' a person seemed to be confused, whilst another said Kayla ''went from high school to mother''.

Replying to comments, she said: ''I did not invest in my skincare routine & stop tanning to be told I look ten years OLDER.

''You went from 19 to 34 but like in a good way,'' read a positive comment.

''You’re really really pretty!! And your skin looks great.''

A second added: ''I’m sorry but these are the features of an older woman, that doesn’t mean it’s an insult, women are beautiful at every age!''

One fan begged: ''I’m going to need your skincare routine please!''

''You look mature not old.. you look gorgeous!'' a user pointed out the difference.

''That comment is crazy. You look amazing and not a day older,'' agreed a fellow viewer.
