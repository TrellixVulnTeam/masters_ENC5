Mason Burstow has been signed from Charlton, but the striker will go straight back out on loan to The Valley for the rest of the season. No other moves came about on deadline days, despite rumours of interest in Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembele.

Much of the focus in the months ahead will likely be on securing contract extensions for those already at the club.

Antonio Rudiger, Cesar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen are all out of contract at the end of the season and face uncertain futures, and the resolution of those situations will be a major factor in what business Chelsea do in the summer.

Here’s a round-up on the main stories from Chelsea’s January business.

Though not yet officially announced, Chelsea have signed Charlton striker Mason Burstow on deadline day.

The 18-year-old will be loaned back to the League One side for the rest of the season, with Charlton boss Johnnie Jackson confirming that a deal had been reached.

There was a brief period in the final hours of the window when a Chelsea move for Ousmane Dembele looked possible, as Barcelona president Joan Laporte confirmed there was a Premier League proposal on the table.

But while the La Liga side were keen to find a buyer for Dembele, no move materialised and as it stands the Frenchman will leave on a free transfer in the summer.

It was a similar situation with Niklas Sule, who is out of contract at Bayern Munich at the end of the season and has shown no signs of agreeing an extension.

Chelsea were heavily linked with the centre-back and while Sule is staying at Bayern for now, the Blues may well make a move in the summer when he is a free agent.

One man who did get a move was Tino Anjorin, the 20-year-old midfielder.

Anjorin was on loan at Lokomotiv Moscow for the first half of the season but returned to Chelsea after suffering a broken metatarsal.

While he is not yet ready to return to action, Anjorin has joined Huddersfield Town on loan for the rest of the season.

Striker Armando Broja has impressed so far this campaign, on loan at Southampton from the Blues.

His performances have led to suggestions that Southampton want to make the move a permanent one, but no decision on that has yet been made. As it stands, Broja will return to Stamford Bridge in the summer.

Leeds star Raphinha was another player linked with a Chelsea move in January, while West Ham were also keen on the Brazilian.

However, Leeds were never likely to let the winger go and the London clubs will have to wait until the summer if they want to go back in for Raphinha.
