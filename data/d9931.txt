A FAMILY were left heartbroken after a DPD van driver ran over their beloved cat and failed to stop.

Nicola Hickson, 46, found black kitten Binx in the road when she went to move her car.

She was shocked to see CCTV of the incident — and her 14-month-old pet writhing in agony. Binx later died.

Now Nicola wants a law change so drivers have to stop when they hit a cat.

The mum of five has the backing of animal charities.

Nicola and son TJ, 13, were “so close” to Binx after ­bottle-feeding him as his mum would not nurse him.

She said: “He was a huge part of our family. We’ve six other cats, but he’s the only one we’ve hand-raised.

“It’s heart-breaking what happened to him. I’ll never forget seeing him lying in the road.

"I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive the driver for not stopping. What kind of monster does that?

“We all need to do more to protect cats. So many are killed or hit by cars.”

Charity Cats Matter says 230,000 a year are run over in the UK, with one in ten drivers leaving a cat to die.

It backs a Cats Bill to require drivers who hit cats to stop and tell police.

Nicola, of Sale, Greater Manchester, backs the law as under the Road Traffic Act (1988) drivers only have to inform cops if they hit a dog, horse or farm animal.

The RSPCA said it was supporting Nicola. It urges motorists to stop if they hit a moggy — and see if they can help by taking it to a vet.

DPD said it was “devastated”.

A spokesman said: “We share Nicola’s concerns. We take firm action when the conduct of our people falls below the high standards we expect.”
