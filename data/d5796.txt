Greenwood, 20, had also been accused of threats to kill having spent three nights in police custody.

The £75,000-a-week Premier League striker was initially arrested on Sunday afternoon on suspicion of the rape and assault of a young woman following social media images and videos posted online.

On Tuesday night, Greater Manchester Police said Greenwood had been further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and threats to kill after detectives were given more time to question him.

The force said in a statement released just before 10.30am on Wednesday: “A 20-year-old man arrested on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman has been released on bail pending further investigation.”

Within hours of the allegations appearing on Sunday morning, the footballer, regarded as one of Manchester United’s rising young stars, was suspended from playing or training with the club until further notice.

The posts have since been deleted from the social media page.

Police forensic officers have been seen parked outside the Greenwood’s £2million house in the village of Bowdon, Cheshire.

Nike has suspended its deal with Greenwood and Electronic Arts has confirmed his removal from active squads on FIFA 22.

In a statement, Manchester United said it “reiterates its strong condemnation of violence of any kind”.

Bradford-born Greenwood joined Manchester United aged six. In March 2019, he became the youngest footballer to play for the club in the Champions League, aged 17.

He made 129 appearances for the Old Trafford club, scoring 35 goals. He has the number 11 shirt previously worn by Ryan Giggs.

England manager Gareth Southgate gave him his first cap at the age of 18 in 2020 - a substitute appearance in a 1-0 away win against Iceland.
