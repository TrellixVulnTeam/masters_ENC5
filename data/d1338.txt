Two people have been taken to hospital following a rush hour crash involving a hearse on the M8 this morning.

Emergency services raced to the three-vehicle collision on the M8 eastbound, after the Kingston Bridge, around 9.50am on Tuesday February 1.

The male driver of a hearse - who was the only occupant - was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, as was the male driver of a Peugeot van.

The female driver of a mini, also involved in the smash, was uninjured.

The incident has sparked traffic chaos this morning as it caused massive tailbacks while the road was closed just after rush hour.

Drivers are being warned to expect delays as congestion in the area clears.

One lane remains shut to allow officers to carry out collision investigations.

A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "Around 9.50 am on Tuesday, 1 February, 2022, police were called to a three vehicle road crash eastbound on the M8 after the Kingston Bridge.





 "The vehicles involved were a mini, a hearse and a Peugeot van.

"The female driver of the Mini was uninjured. The male drivers of the hearse and van have been taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. No details on injury, if any.

"The road is down to one lane to allow officers to carry out their enquiries."
