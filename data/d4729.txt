Tax rises are on the horizon for most of us in the coming months, but for many the biggest sting will come after life; in the form of the widely unpopular inheritance tax.

Gifting a property is an increasingly popular way of reducing the value of an estate for inheritance tax purposes, but there are other tax implications to consider. These vary depending on whether you know the person you are giving the property to, their age and whether it has a mortgage attached to it.

If a property is given away or sold at less than market value, any taxes will still be payable as if it was being paid for at market value, provided that the person receiving it is a "connected person".

This includes family members – children, parents, grandparents (though not cousins) – as well as family trusts and businesses that are controlled by the giver.

The only way this does not apply is if the sale is a "bargain at arm's length" between two unconnected people, for example a distressed sale at auction.

Giving a property away is a disposal for capital gains tax purposes. It applies when you sell a property that has not been your main residence for the whole time you have owned it.

If the property has always been a buy-to-let, the tax is due on the entire period it has been owned by you.

But if it has had a mixture of uses, such as a buy-to-let half the time and a main residence for the other half, the calculations are adjusted to match the split.

CGT is paid on the increase in the property's value since it was bought, less expenses such as stamp duty and legal fees.
