It looks like horror anthology series The Dark Pictures will end up with at least 10 entries, including possibly the first sci-fi one.

Initially promoted as the spiritual successor to PlayStation exclusive Until Dawn, by the same studio, The Dark Pictures has never seemed to have the same impact and there was some surprise when a fourth game was announced after last year’s House Of Ashes.

It seems that won’t be the last one either though, with no less than five new titles being unearthed via registrations at the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO).

The trademarks were registered by developer Supermassive Games, so it’s unclear if original publisher Bandai Namco is still involved or which order they might be released in, since they were all registered on the same day.

Each name already has its own logo, some of which make it possible to guess what the story might involve. Directive 8020, for example, has a more futuristic font and there seems to be an image of the Moon in the logo – so it may have the first sci-fi setting for one of the games.

O Death is likely a reference to a traditional American folk song, which involves meeting a personification of Death and trying to bargain for more life.

An alternative meaning of the word Intercession is to pray on behalf of someone else, so with the upside down cross it seems the game will have some heavy religious themes.

Previous games have been based on existing urban legends and stories, albeit it often quite obscure ones, but we can’t find any clue as to what Winterfold or The Craven Man might involve.

Winterfold’s logo seems to suggest an urban setting though, while The Craven Man’s font and logo might hint at some kind of paganistic theme, with nods perhaps to The Wicker Man.

A tenth game was also leaked last year, called Switchback, but while it has its own logo as well there doesn’t seem to be anyway to guess what it might be about.

The fourth game in the series, The Devil In Me, is already due out later this year and if it follows the same trend as the previous games it will include a teaser for the next game, which will presumably be one of the six above.
