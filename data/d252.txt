“That was a very difficult and fraught time in our city and I think that many people carry the trauma of that moment and others like it with them to this very day,” Lightfoot said. “What I will also say is, looking back on that time right before Thanksgiving of 2015 when the video was first released, there were some things that I think helped our city move forward that came out … not the least of which I think is the level of activism across our city, many young people, many people of different generations, let their voices be heard and demanded change and there has been some change. Not enough. Not enough by any stretch of the imagination. But I think some significant things have happened and continue to happen that we need to take stock of in light of this moment.”
