The first Covid-19 vaccine for children aged from just six months to five years old could be available as soon as the end of February, according to reports.

U.S. regulators are urging drugmaker Pfizer to apply for emergency authorization for a two-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine for children in the age group, a person familiar with the matter told the Washington Post on Monday.

Officials are aiming to to clear the way for the shots to be used as soon as late February, the source said.

Meanwhile, regulators are also awaiting data on a three-dose course that they hope will prove more effective for children, the Associated Press has reported.

The company’s application was expected to be submitted as soon as Tuesday.

However, research shows that Covid poses a very low risk to babies and toddlers, and previous decisions to offer vaccines to children have caused controversy.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows as of January 22, there have been 280 deaths involving Covid among children aged between zero and four years old. That number rises to 603 for those aged from five to 18 years old.

Combined, deaths involving Covid among those 18-and-under make up around 0.102 percent of America’s 864,256 total deaths, as of January 22.

If approved, the U.S. would become one of the only countries in the world to begin vaccinating young children as young as six months, with Cuba being the only other known country vaccinating children as young as two years old.
