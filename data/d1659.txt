Rachel Maddow, the top-rated anchor on MSNBC and one of the most influential figures in liberal media, is set to take a hiatus from her nightly cable program.

Her break is expected to last until April, although a return date has not been specified, according to two people at the network with knowledge of her plans, requesting anonymity to describe private discussions. She is expected to begin her leave after Thursday’s broadcast.

“I am going to take a little bit of time off from this show,” Ms. Maddow told viewers at the start of her Monday night show. “I’m nervous about all this. It’s a change in my life. But it’s all for the good.”

Whether Ms. Maddow returns to a full slate of nightly broadcasts, or dials back her schedule to something less grueling, has been the subject of speculation among some MSNBC anchors and producers. She signaled on Monday that she was contemplating more time away.
