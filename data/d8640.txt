A STRAY Staffie dog who was rescued by a Kidderminster charity now needs a new home.

Archie arrived at Happy Staffie Rescue earlier this month and is estimated to be about five years old.

The medium sized dog is a brindle boy, possible Staffie-x with a friendly, excitable and energetic personality.

Happy Staffie Rescue posted on their website: “Archie arrived in our care without a microchip or vaccinations and has not been neutered. He will be visiting our vets shortly for a check-up, microchipping and to restart vaccinations.

“Archie comes across as a very friendly, sociable dog, with no nervousness meeting new people. He loves to play, and will bring toys back. He also will happily and merrily destroy what toys he can.

“Taking treats Archie tries his best to be gentle but he can be over-enthusiastic and may accidentally catch the tip(s) of your fingers.

“Our first walks with Archie have been with a slip-lead only, and although he weaves left and right he is not yet showing himself to be a massive puller.

“However, he does appear a naturally strong dog and he may pull hard if the occasion arises – we just haven’t seen it yet. On our initial walks we have passed other people, traffic and cyclists but no dogs.”

The charity wants to find a home for Archie with no other dogs, no cats, no children under the age of 13 living in or regularly visiting, no cages/crates in the home, an active home where Archie can have lots of walks and play time, an experienced owner, access to his own private, secure garden, a minimal time left alone at a time, and access to a sofa.

Full information about Archie and how to adopt can be found on the Happy Staffie Rescue website.
