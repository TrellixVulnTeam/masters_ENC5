Biden’s economy is in free fall. It’s as if he wants to destroy the US economy.

A couple of days ago we reported on inflation in the US reaching 40-year highs.

At Thanksgiving, we reported on sales being way down for the first time ever.

The list goes on and on.

Today we can add the US Deficit to the list. Under Biden, the US debt surpassed $30 Trillion for the first time ever.

The last President to lower the deficit was President Trump in his first year in office. But the Fed kept raising rates which eventually made it impossible to pay off the debt as more money went towards interest. Now the Fed has rates back at zero percent which is the preferred rate for Democrats when in office. If the rates were any higher, Biden would have increased the debt sooner.
