A NEW budget airline has launched cheap flights from the UK to New York from just £139.

Airline PLAY, which launched last year, has announced the cheap introductory flights to celebrate the new route.

The flights, on sale from today, will fly from London Stansted to New York Stewart International Airport, a smaller airport just outside the city.

The bargain £139 fares are only on offer until February 7, and standard fares will cost £159, with four flights a week.

However, the reason for the low fares is because they include a layover, so you will have to stop for 1hr35 in Reykjavik.

Passengers will need to pay for extras such as baggage and legroom but they can take a personal item onboard with them.

PLAY CEO Birgir Jónsson, PLAY CEO, said: “After we learnt of the surge in the area surrounding New York Stewart and the benefits it offers, we did not hesitate in snapping up the chance to operate from this airport."

UK travellers may not have heard of the New York airport, with the commonly used airports being JFK and Newark.

However, Stewart Airport has shuttle buses to the city centre, taking 90 minutes, or train services from nearby Beacon Station to the city.

PLAY has already announced bargain fares to other US hotspots which are launching this year.

Also travelling from London Stansted, flights to Baltimore/Washington International Airport will launch from April 20, and from May 11 to Boston Logan International Airport.

The airline takes the place of WOW Air, an Icelandic airline that offered UK-US fares for as little as £99, which went bust back in 2019.

And Norwegian, who once offered low fares between the UK and the US, scrapped the long-haul flights last year due to Covid.

JetBlue currenty has cheap fares between the UK and New York, from £319.
