Boris Johnson is due to speak with Vladimir Putin today, following the president’s accusation that the West is ignoring Russia’s security concerns.

The Kremlin said that it would provide details if and when President Putin spoke to PM Boris Johnson by phone and that Mr Putin was ready to talk to anyone, including the “utterly confused”.

In his first public comments on the Ukraine crisis since December, Mr Putin yesterday criticised the delivery of military aid to Ukraine and said he believed that the country was being “packed full of weapons”.

Mr Johnson also warned yesterday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a “political disaster, a humanitarian disaster and a military disaster”.

In a press conference held in Kyiv on Tuesday, Mr Johnson added the UK will impose sanctions the “moment the first Russian toecap” breaches the border with the eastern European country.

“We have the sanctions ready,” he added in his opening statement alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Following the conference, a joint statement issued by the two leaders declared Britain stands “shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.”
