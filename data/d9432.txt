Costa Coffee has revealed a new menu item in time for Valentine’s Day this year.

For those of us who enjoy the various cold drinks already on the menu, a new cooler being added to it could be just what was needed to brighten up your week.

Costa Coffee took to Twitter to tell its followers about the arrival of the new raspberry and Belgian chocolate drink named Cupid’s Cooler.

The account tweeted: “It’s time to make a real commitment to deliciousness. Feel good this Valentine’s Day and indulge with the new raspberry and Belgian chocolate Cupid’s Cooler – available from the 3rd to 17th February”

The tweet ends with a heart emoji and features a short proposal type video with a first glance of the drink.

As mentioned in the tweet, the new drink is available for a short time only – from Thursday February 3 to Thursday February 17, 2022.

If you want to try Cupid’s cooler, you’ll have to make sure you do before the two-week period is up.

The news of a new drink at Costa Coffee comes after the new range of limited-edition coffees was announced late last year.

Also announced recently was the winner of the Costa Book of the Year Award 2021.
