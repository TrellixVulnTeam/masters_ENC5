RAF jets have been scrambled to intercept unidentified aircraft near Scotland.

Typhoons from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray and a Voyager fuel tanker from RAF Brize Norton are involved.

An RAF spokesman said: "Quick reaction alert Typhoon fighters from RAF Lossiemouth, supported by a Voyager Tanker from RAF Brize Norton, have been launched against unidentified aircraft approaching the UK area of interest.

"We will not be offering any additional detail on this ongoing operation until complete."

The scrambling of jets is not uncommon, with the RAF primed and ready to intercept any unrecognised aircraft at all times.

They have been launched in the past to shadow Russian military aircraft flown near UK airspace.

A quick reaction alert (QRA) is not uncommon and have been around since the Cold War.

Russian war planes can be a hazard as they do not "squawk" or transmit codes revealing their altitude and intentions.

They also do not talk to UK air traffic controllers, meaning other planes have to be re-routed to avoid a disastrous accident.
