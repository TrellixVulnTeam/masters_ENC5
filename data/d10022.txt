Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy has appeared in court to face a new allegation of attempted rape.

The 27-year-old appeared in the dock at Chester Crown Court, where a judge ruled that the new charge the French international faces can now be reported.

Mendy now faces nine charges in all, including seven counts of rape involving six alleged victims.

At the pre-trial hearing, Judge Patrick Thompson urged lawyers to ensure there is no delay and that the case will be ready as he set a date for a trial, estimated to last up to six weeks, starting on July 25.

He said: "It's not fair on the complainants and not fair on the defendants."

"I'm conscious of the fact that the complainants have already suffered significant delay."

"Say, for example, Mr Mendy, his career is on hold. Everyone has got to understand Mr Mendy can't go to work. This matter needs to be tried."

The defendant, wearing a dark grey suit, white shirt and black tie, spoke only to confirm his identity and leaned his head towards a French interpreter who sat between him and his co-defendant, Louis Saha Matturie.
