OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — Gunfire erupted near the presidential palace. Military trucks raced through the streets as civilians fled. The country’s president vanished from view.

The small West African nation of Guinea-Bissau appeared to be hurtling toward a military coup on Tuesday — the latest in a spate of military takeovers across a swath of Africa in the past year that has signaled a worrisome democratic backslide. But hours later, the country’s leader suddenly reappeared to declare he had thwarted his armed foes.

Addressing the local news media, President Umaro Sissoco Embaló said that “many” members of his own security forces had been killed in what he termed a “failed attack against democracy” with possible links to drug trafficking. Others had been arrested, he said, but he could not say how many.

“It wasn’t just a coup,” he said. “It was an attempt to kill the president, the prime minister and the entire cabinet.”
