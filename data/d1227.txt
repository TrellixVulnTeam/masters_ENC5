A previous presidential candidate claims the president selected the current vice president based on race and sex.

Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) revealed the president did not appoint Kamala Harris as his second-in-command due to merit.

“Biden chose Harris as his VP because of the color of her skin and sex—not qualification,” Gabbard said on Twitter.

The unsuccessful 2020 presidential candidate expressed deep disappointment with Harris’s performance in the White House.

“She has been a disaster,” she said. “Identity politics is destroying our country.”

Gabbard suggested that the recent controversy surrounding President Biden’s promise to nominate a black woman as U.S. Supreme Court justice is another token gesture.

“Now he promises to choose Supreme Court nominee on the same criteria,” she said.

The latest ABC News/Ipsos poll found that more than three-quarters (76%) of Americans want the president to consider all potential candidates regardless of their skin color.

Only 23% of 510 respondents support Biden’s plan to appoint a black woman to the nation’s highest court.

“On the Supreme Court Americans are divided on the legal versus political nature of justices,” the summary of findings said. “However, a majority of Americans believe Biden should cast a wide net for potential new justices and not only consider black women as he has pledged to do.”
