CNN’s President Jeff Zucker is resigning from the cable news network, “effective immediately.” The cable outlet just reported the news.

“CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker said Wednesday that he is resigning, effective immediately,” Brian Stelter reported.

Zucker said in a memo: “As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years. I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong. As a result, I am resigning today.”

“Zucker did not name his colleague in the memo, but the relationship is with Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer for CNN. Gollust is remaining at CNN,” he said.

“In an email to staffers sent shortly after Zucker’s, Jason Kilar, the CEO of CNN parent WarnerMedia, said” “I have accepted Jeff Zucker’s resignation as Chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports, and President of CNN Worldwide. We thank Jeff for his contributions over the past 9 years.”

Kilar added: “We will be announcing an interim leadership plan shortly. Both of these organizations are at the top of their respective games and are well prepared for their next chapters.”

The real “bombshell” is that Zucker is resigning for yet another sex scandal at CNN, and not the network’s tanking ratings.
