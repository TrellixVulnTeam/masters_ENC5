A321 TOGA and Tail Strike!

A full-on Touch and go, with a tail strike! Watch for the paint dust after contact and watch the empennage shaking as it drags. The pilot deserves a medal! BA training could use this in a scenario - happy to send the footage chaps ðŸ˜‰#aviation #AvGeek pic.twitter.com/ibXjmVJGiT
