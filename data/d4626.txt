AN unlucky motorist could get a shock fine after a seagull swiped their parking ticket.

Local insurance broker James Earley, 55, pictured the bird in the act on Monday in Brighton.

He said: “Someone will get a nasty surprise in the post.

“I expected it to fly off when I tried to take a photo but it just ignored me and was determined to get the ticket.

“Poor driver won’t know until they get a reminder through.”

A ticket, £50 to £70, can be halved if paid within 14 days.

However, it looks like a reduced fine isn't an option for the driver of this car as the bird made off with the evidence.

Seagulls in Brighton are known for being particularly brazen when it comes to stealing from humans - often nabbing food from people's hands.
