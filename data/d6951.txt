Wrapping up the Costa Book Awards for another year, former London teacher Hannah Lowe has won the £30,000 prize for her book of sonnets, The Kids.

The collection of poems draws upon her experiences teaching in an inner-city London sixth form, with the judges saying it was a “book to fall in love with.”

Now in its 50th year, the Costa awards is one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the UK and honours the most enjoyable titles from the last year by writers in Britain and Ireland. The awards span five categories – debut, biography, poetry, children’s and novel – with one of the five chosen tomes then crowned the overall winner.

This year’s winning Costa Book of the Year was said by the judges to be “insightful”, “empathetic”, “generous”, “funny”, “compassionate” and “uplifting”. Lowe’s collection of poetry fought off fierce competition from titles including the bookies’ favourite novel Unsettled Ground by Claire Fuller (£7.49, Waterstones.com) as well as Caleb Azumah Nelson’s searing debut Open Water (£7.49, Waterstones.com).

To mark 2021’s winner, we take a look at The Kids and the four books that preceded Lowe’s win, all of which showcase the very best of the UK’s literary landscape.
