You’re reading Move, the nudge we need to get active, however makes us happiest and healthiest.

Adding exercise into your morning routine will help you kickstart your day with energy and enthusiasm – and you only need to adjust your alarm by five minutes.

A quick burst of movement is enough to get those endorphins pumping and make you feel like you’ve achieved something before the work day has even begun.

Emma McQuaid, a CrossFit Games athlete who’s dubbed ‘Ireland’s fittest woman,’ has provided HuffPost UK with a fast, five-minute workout for you to try when you get out of bed.

“This will get the body moving to kickstart the day, opening up the hips, lower and upper back which is great first thing in the morning to wake up your muscles,” she explains.

The stretch is then followed by a three-minute AMRAP, which stands for ‘as many repetitions or rounds as possible’.

“The 3 minute AMRAP has midline, lower and upper body for a quick total body hit for a perfect start to your day,” McQuaid says. “I find lunges amazing to get your glutes firing, especially if you have a desk job, with the rotation also activating the core.”

Give it a try by following these instructions:

1 minute each side: World’s Greatest Stretch

3 Minute AMRAP (as many rounds and reps as possible)

20 Lunge Rotations

15 Tuck Sit Ups

10 Burpee
