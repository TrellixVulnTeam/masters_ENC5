These two I find troubling. It was said that Pence took over Healthcare in 2019. This article is about pro-life influence, but it claims, half a year before COVID happened, that Pence had taken over.

That positioned Pence quite well. When the chips were down, throw a few friends under the bus and convince Trump to give you the lead.

I am now very curious about the ‘origination’ of Covid. Much more than before.

What was Pence’s role in getting the ‘Modernization of the Flu Vaccine’ EO? It was a Soviet style 5-year plan intending to replace flu shots with futuristic jabs, of which mRNA was a candidate. And it was signed in September 2019. Plenty of time after Politico reported Pence’s fait accompli of a takeover for this to be his effort.

There are reports out there of evidence of the virus rampaging in Wuhan in October, some even go so far as to say August. September was the very month where China started hiding the evidence of bat coronaviruses.

I know this is after the fact hindsight, but it is scary how some dominoes were all laid in advance for COVID to be used to destroy Trump. And definitely worth an investigation.
