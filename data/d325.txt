Bianca Gascoigne has spoken about the moment that doctors discovered a potentially dangerous leak in a ruptured breast implant.

The 34-year-old reality star had gone to see a doctor about having a breast reduction, when the leak was found.

She has had a number of cosmetic procedures, including two boob jobs and a Brazilian butt lift but she found that she had a rupture in her breasts when she looked to have them reduced from 34E.

Bianca has told The Sun that she could have been left in unbearable pain if the leak had gone unnoticed.

Speaking about the discovery, she said: "It's scary. When they told me, I was freaked out. Thank God they found out and dealt with it while I was under anaesthetic, otherwise I would have majorly panicked."

She said the discovery "confirmed to me that this decision to go smaller was the right one for me," and that she was "just relieved it's out."

The former CelebrityBig Brother star has battled body dysmorphia since she was 13 and is fearful of falling pregnant as she dreads how her body will change.

Bianca has been dating Kris Boyson for nine months, after the PT instructor had a tumultuous relationship with former glamour model Katie Price.

Bianca said that she has discussed marriage and children with Kris but admits she is panicking about looking "the size of a house" if she fell pregnant.

The former Celebrity Love Island winner, who is the adopted daughter of Paul Gascoigne said: "I want children in the future, I hope I can get over this mental illness.

"But Iâ€™m just so worried about how gaining weight like that will affect my body dysmorphia.

"The thought of having no control over my weight really scares me."
