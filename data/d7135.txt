FORMER Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata is likely to return to the Premier League in the summer, according to reports.

That should alert fierce rivals Arsenal and Tottenham, who were both linked with the Spaniard before the transfer window slammed shut.

Morata, 29, is on loan at Juventus from Atletico Madrid.

But the Italian side are surely out of the running for a permanent deal after they signed Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina.

According to Marca, the Premier League is the 'prime destination' for Morata in the summer.

The report states that Atletico boss Diego Simone 'does not want the player in his squad' and that 'Juventus will not exercise the purchase option'.

AS reported that a potential move to Barcelona was blocked by Atletico, who do not want to lose the striker to a LaLiga rival.

But relations between Morata and boss Diego Simeone have soured and Atletico know they must move him on or risk being left with a sulky player when he returns from Juve.

Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal assistant Miguel Molina has reportedly spoken with Morata directly about a possible move to the Emirates.

Arteta is desperate for a goalscorer having seen his side fail to hit the net in four games on the bounce.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyan’s fall from grace has taken him to Barcelona on a free transfer, while Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah can hardly buy a goal between them.

Both are also out of contract in the summer.

Tottenham boss Antonio Conte is also keen on Morata after seeing target Adama Traore head to the Nou Camp instead.
