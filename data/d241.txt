Even though Donald Trump is begrudgingly holding what will surely be a disastrous campaign rally on Monday for Perdue and Loeffler in Georgia, he’s spent all week dishonestly attacking Georgia’s Republican leadership, meaning he’s not really helping his party’s chances.

Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden, who just won Georgia, is now set to campaign in person in the state on behalf of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. This is a big deal because if both Democrats win, President Biden will be dealing with a Democratic-controlled Senate instead of Mitch McConnell’s current Senate cesspool.

Meanwhile Donald Trump is busy tweeting conspiracy theories about Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s imaginary brother, while calling for Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to resign. Trump knows his life is over, and he’s trying to take the Republicans down with him. We can’t wait to see how much damage he does to his own party during his rally on Monday.
