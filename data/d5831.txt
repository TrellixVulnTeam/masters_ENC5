The defensive duo were out with Covid and a hamstring injury respectively but both rejoined the Chelsea squad when players returned to training on Tuesday.

After being given a week off by Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea will be hoping to return from the break rejuvenated for the second half of the season.

Reece James was not pictured with the Chelsea squad but he is said to be on course to return in time to feature at the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi later this month.

Chelsea return to action on Saturday when they host League One side Plymouth Argyle Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup.

They then fly out to Abu Dhabi and the return of Chalobah and Christensen, and the expected return of James, is a boost for Tuchel ahead of an important month.

The trio should all be fully fit in time for the knock-out stage of the Champions League.

Chelsea play the first leg of their last-16 tie against Lille on February 22.

They also meet Liverpool in the EFL Cup Final at Wembley five days later.
