You know how we’ve been talking about how Congress can object to the electoral college results on January 6?

You know how we’ve been talking about how that’s the process in the Constitution?

Well, Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi are now reportedly teaming up to pass a new law BLOCKING any such challenge.

Mitch McConnell has now thoroughly outed himself as an enemy not only to Republicans but to the Republic.

And perhaps that’s how this always had to go?

Perhaps that’s why President Trump is letting this drag out?

To let every single member of The Swamp out themselves before he swoops in and presents the irrefutable evidence?

It’s starting to feel like that to me.

For a couple weeks now, we’ve been telling you that we needed just ONE Senator to join with the Representatives to officially challenge the electoral college results.

That would then send it to a decision by the states and the Republicans hold a 35 state majority in that analysis.

Well, today we got our one Senator, the WISE and COURAGEOUS Sen. Josh Hawley from the great state of Missouri:

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Wednesday became the first Republican senator to publicly say he will object to the certification of the presidential election results when a joint session of Congress meets in one week to formally certify President-elect Joe Biden’s 306-232 Electoral College victory over President Trump. Roughly a dozen Trump supporters in the House – led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama – have said they will challenge the slate of electors from six battleground states where Biden narrowly edged Trump in last month’s election. But the challenge of at least one senator is needed for both houses of Congress to debate the objections. Hawley, a conservative lawmaker and Trump supporter, said in a release issued Wednesday that in his objection he’ll highlight what he said was the failure of some states – most notably Pennsylvania – to follow their own election laws. A number of states – including Pennsylvania – allowed for a greater use of absentee balloting due to serious health concerns over in-person voting at polling stations amid the coronavirus pandemic. “I cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws,” the senator highlighted in a statement. Hawley also charged, “I cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden. At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act.” He pointed out that “following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity. They were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.”

And nearly just as soon as that news broke, news also broke that Mitch McConnell was betraying the Republican party and every single person who voted for him to team up with NANCY PELOSI to try and stop the ability for these Senators to object.

I am FUMING as I type this!

The word comes directly from Marjorie Taylor Greene, a truly great Republican.
