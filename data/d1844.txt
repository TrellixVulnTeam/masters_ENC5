England head north to try and get revenge on Scotland in the opening round of the 2022 Six Nations. For the first time in 38 years, Scotland won at Twickenham and Eddie Jones' side will be eager to get their hands back on the Calcutta Cup.

What is the latest squad news?

Gregor Townsend named five uncapped players in Scotland's 39-man squad for the upcoming Guinness Six Nations.

Saracens back-rower Andy Christie and London Irish scrum-half Ben White are two of the new faces in the pool.

Rory Darge, Ben Vellacott and Kyle Rowe are also rewarded with call-ups ahead of Scotland's first game of the championship against England at Murrayfield on Saturday February 5.

Bath centre Cameron Redpath, who enjoyed a memorable debut against England last year, has recovered from injury and will once again be in contention ahead of the Six Nations opener.

Ewan Ashman, Jamie Hodgson, Javan Sebastian, Pierre Schoeman, Rufus McLean and Sione Tuipulotu, who all received their first Scotland caps in the recent autumn Tests, are included once again.

Elsewhere there are call-ups for Edinburgh back-row Magnus Bradbury and prop WP Nel, who missed out on selection for the Autumn Nations, as well as Exeter lock Jonny Gray, who also returns.

Northampton centre Rory Hutchinson is included having not featured for Scotland in 2021.

Captain Stuart Hogg is joined by fellow British and Irish Lions Finn Russell, Ali Price, Zander Fagerson, Chris Harris, Rory Sutherland, Duhan van der Merwe and Hamish Watson.

Fraser Brown, Adam Hastings, Sean Maitland and George Horne are among the most notable omissions.

The squad will meet up at Oriam on Monday 24 January for a training camp before reconvening the following week ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash.

England's initial Six Nations squad has been hit by injuries with Owen Farrell, Jonny May and Tommy Freeman withdrawn. Courtney Lawes and Jonny Hill remain injury doubts for the Scotland match while Joe Marchant is expected to miss out with Covid. As cover, Eddie Jones has added wingers Louis Lynagh and Adam Radwan to the squad.

In better news for England, Joe Marler, who tested positive for coronavirus last week, is back in training having completed his period of isolation.

What happened in this fixture in 2021?

Scotland defeated England at Twickenham for the first time in 38 years. In what was a turgid match, England's indiscipline was costly and they could not swing the momentum back in their favour.

Cameron Redpath, on his debut, was very impressive for Scotland and he will be back in the mix for this weekend having recovered from a long-term injury.

What are they saying?

England must end reputation of being slow starters - Scotland are favourites for Six Nations opener

In contrast, England have a very tricky opener at Murrayfield. The absences of Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes and Joe Marler have shorn them yet further of leaders on the field. They will face a Scotland side desperate to build on a decent autumn international series and one who reversed 38 years of losses at Twickenham in last season’s Six Nations. The relatively settled nature of the Scotland side and Murrayfield make the Scots favourites and, if they were to win, they would go to Cardiff to face a Wales side who have to negotiate a difficult opening game away against Ireland. In that game the Irish are definitely favourites and should Wales lose they are facing the nightmare start identified above. In this scenario, a Scotland win would put them at the top of the table, either outright or with the French or Irish.
