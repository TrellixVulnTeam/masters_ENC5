EVERYONE loves a good spag bol - but it can be tricky to make a mince-based meal without it being super fatty.

This TikTok user blew her followers’ minds when she revealed her ultimate hack for making sure your mince dishes don’t wind up being too greasy.

Holly shared the no-effort hack on her page and immediately went viral, racking up eight million views.

In the video, she said: “Best cooking hack ever. Fold up a paper towel, put it in your tongs, point your grease to the bottom of the pan, pick it up, easy disposal.”

This way, you don’t need to riskily pour excess grease into the bin, narrowly avoiding all your food falling in there too.

Plus, for those among us who pour excess grease down the sink - this could be the way to save your drains!

The clip amassed almost 200,000 likes and commenters could not wait to try the hack for themselves.

“I have a fine colander for this - the paper towel is a nice way to skip that step”, wrote one viewer, while a second added: “Great idea!”

“Why did no one tell me about this?! It’s awesome, thank you very much”, enthused a third.

A fourth simply said: “Never knew this. Thank you.”

Some, however, had been using the hack for years.

“Been doing this forever. Save your sink drains from becoming blocked from straining it in the sink. People forget that once it cools it’s a solid”, said one viewer.

Another added: “Been doing it that way for years!”
