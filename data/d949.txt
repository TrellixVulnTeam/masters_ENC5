In between the literal lack of Vitamin D and the bouts of maskne, our faces haven’t exactly been looking their best in 2020.

But that’s not to say that beauty products haven’t marked the long and winding road which has defined this year. In fact, where nothing’s happened, yet everything’s changed, there are areas within the beauty realm which have seen sales soar exponentially.

So we thought it apropos to round up the beauty products that have sold through the roof this year, not only to mark the fact that hurrah! We made it through 2020, but also to nudge you in the right direction for any Twixmas purchases you may be so inclined to buy.

It just wouldn’t be 2020 without a glut of hand sanitiser, now, would it? In the year that the virtues of cleaning your hands for a full twenty seconds were extolled at large, sales of the alcohol-filled steriliser rose by 255 per cent in March, when the UK first went into lockdown. LVMH and Bulgari were just a few of the big budget brands which pivoted their services to craft big batches of hand sanitiser in order to meet demand.

But, not all hand sanitisers were created equally. Aesop’s Resurrection Rinse-Free Hand Wash feels the most like a party for your hands on application and smells the least offensive of the batch I’ve sampled this year. Queen of anti-aging Susanne Kaufmann’s Skin-Friendly Antibacterial Hand Gel is also the stuff of hand sanitising dreams, with its spray application.

As part of its annual beauty round-up, John Lewis & Partners reported that sales of its mascaras have increased by 58 per cent, a result no doubt of the decree to cover our mouths for much of this year.

And luckily for us mascara mavens, there’s been no shortage of lash-lengthening launches this year. Earlier in July, Hourglass launched its Unlocked Instant Extensions Mascara to rapturous applause. Space NK noted that it was its fastest-selling mascara ever, selling at a rate of 1.6 units per minute upon its launch, while doyenne of beauty Charlotte Tilbury launched her self-proclaimed push-up bra for lashes, her Pillow Talk Mascara, just one month later, with 96 per cent of people agreeing that the mascara visibly lifted lashes and 93 per cent agreeing that it gave lashes voluminous definition.

As we became ensconced in the confines of the same four walls for much of this year, sales of oh-so-faithfully brightening Vitamin C products rocketed.

At John Lewis & Partners this year, sales of Vitamin C products soared by 248 per cent, while Space NK reported that its best-selling serum of 2020 was Drunk Elephant’s potent C-Firma Day Serum, which is jam-packed with L-Ascorbic Acid.

Space NK reported that “Olaplex became our top haircare brand after launching with us in June 2019." Almost a quarter of all haircare sales at Space NK this year are from the Olaplex range, while LookFantastic also reported that its number one best-selling product of 2020 was Olaplex No 3 Hair Perfector Treatment.

The Perfume Shop recorded a 45 per cent growth in perfume sales during the first lockdown in March and is it any wonder when we’ve all been clutching at straws for anything to spice up our lives?
