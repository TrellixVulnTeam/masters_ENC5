PRIME Minister Boris Johnson hailed a "new beginning" as he signed his Brexit deal - after MPs voted to make it law this afternoon.

The House of Commons passed the agreement 521 to 73 as history was made in the House of Commons.

Four years, six months and seven days after the nation opted for Brexit, MPs rubber stamped his agreement - which will come into force tomorrow night.

The second and third readings passed overwhelmingly - and now it goes to the House of Lords and finally to be rubber stamped by the Queen later.
