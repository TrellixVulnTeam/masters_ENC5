Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau is still in hiding, afraid to return to his job as Prime Minister in the capital city of Ottawa. Horrified by the Freedom Convoy and the groundswell of national and global support for the pro-freedom movement and calls for an end to vaccine mandates, Trudeau has decided to doubled-down on his increasingly unpopular stance – taking to a podium set-up outside the front door of his holiday cabin before attacking any dissenters and telling a litany of lies about the Trucker protests – accusing them of being “racist” and ‘far-right,’ and even going so far as to accuse protesters of “stealing food from the homeless” – all in a vane attempt to turn the Canadian citizenry against the demonstrators.

Unfortunately for Trudeau, his tactics have failed spectacularly.

These tweets demonstrate total loss of contact with reality.

This LETTER ,“Letter To A Tyrant,” by Margaret Anna Alice, is absolutely brilliant.
