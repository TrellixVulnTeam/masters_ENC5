Channel 4's Head of Sport Pete Andrews said: "This is one of the few major honours to have eluded Chelsea so it'd be great if they can make history live on Channel 4.

"We're delighted to be bringing top-flight football live on free to air terrestrial television, let's just hope The Blues can go all the way."

The last non-European side to win the Club World Cup were Corinthians in 2012 - when they beat Chelsea 1-0 in Japan.

Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona have all brought the trophy back to Europe in recent years.
