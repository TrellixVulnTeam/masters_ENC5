KP Snacks has warned there may be a shortage of some of its popular crisps and nuts following a ransomware attack.

The company, which is behind brands such as Skips, Nik Naks, Hula Hoops, McCoy's crisps and KP Nuts, told its retail customers to brace for delays and cancellations of deliveries.

In a letter seen by trade publisher Better Retailing, KP Snacks said disruption could last “until the end of March at the earliest”.

Nisa told its partnered stores that no orders would be placed or delivered “for a couple of weeks at least” and to “expect supply issues on base stock and promotions until further notice”.

The company, which is based in Hayes, discovered the cyber attack on Jan. 28.

A spokesman said: “ As soon as we became aware of the incident, we enacted our cybersecurity response plan and engaged a leading forensic information technology firm and legal counsel to assist us in our investigation.

“Our internal IT teams continue to work with third-party experts to assess the situation.”

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents the victim from accessing their computer or certain data stored on it.

Hackers demand payment, often in the form of cryptocurrency, in exchange for restoring access to the computer or the data.

However, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) does not “encourage, endorse, nor condone” the payment of ransom demands as there is no guarantee it will clear the computer from malicious software.

It also means victims will be paying criminal groups and they are more likely to be targeted in the future.

The NCSC has previously warned of rising threats from cybercrime.

In the first four months of 2021, the agency handled the same number of ransomware incidents as for the whole of 2020, when incidents had already grown three-fold on 2019.
