AIM: To compare the results of administration of hyaluronic acid (HA) gel to no gel administration following alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) in terms of changes in wound dimensions over time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systemically healthy patients scheduled for ARP at one or two sites in the incisor, cuspid, or premolar area with at least one neighbouring tooth and>50% buccal bone present following extraction were included. ARP consisted of socket grafting with collagen-enriched, deproteinized bovine bone mineral and socket sealing by means of a collagen matrix. Following surgical therapy, sites were randomly allocated to the control group (no gel application) or the test group (0.8% HA gel applied onto the collagen matrix three times per day for 7 days). Bucco-lingual and mesio-distal wound dimensions were registered at T0 (immediately post operation), T1 (1 week), and T2 (3 weeks). Patient-reported outcomes, clinical outcomes, and hard and soft tissue changes were recorded up to 4 months (T3).

RESULTS: In the control group, 20 patients (7 males, 13 females; mean age 53.30) with 23 sites, and in the test group 18 patients (9 males, 9 females; mean age 52.56) with 23 sites, were included. There were no significant differences between the groups in the changes in wound dimensions from T0 to T2 (bucco-lingual aspect: p = .340; mesio-distal aspect: p = .883). Three sites (13%) in the control group and six (26%) in the test group demonstrated complete wound resolution at T2 (p = .259). HA failed to show any effect on the number of analgesics taken (p = .175), patient-reported outcomes (p ≥ .263), alveolitis (p = .136), socket healing (p ≥ .424), soft tissue changes (p ≥ .064), or mucosal scarring (p = .548). However, significantly more horizontal bone loss at the coronal aspect was found in the test group (p ≤ .025).

CONCLUSION: HA failed to promote wound resolution on a collagen matrix. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04467736).
