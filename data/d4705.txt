Thousands of pension savers could be missing out on vital protection against punitive 55pc tax charges.

More than 8,500 people were handed tax bills in the 2019-20 financial year for breaching the limit on pension savings, paying £342m in additional charges.

The “lifetime allowance” is the maximum amount that you can have in your pension pot before tax becomes payable, currently £1,073,100.

Taking any excess pension money above the limit triggers a 55pc tax bill if taken as a lump sum, or 25pc if drawn as income.

However, a large number of savers can apply for “protection” which shields their pension. Successive cuts to the lifetime allowance sparked a backlash from those already close to the threshold. In response HM Revenue & Customs introduced protections for those who exceeded it.

The lifetime allowance was reduced from £1.25m to £1m in April 2016 but those close to, or already exceeding the limit at the time, were allowed to apply to be exempted and to retain the previous limit.

Nearly 72,000 people have protected their pension against the 2016 lifetime allowance change, a Freedom of Information request submitted by LCP, a consultancy, has revealed.
