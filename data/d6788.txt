The Manchester United player Mason Greenwood has been bailed following his arrest on suspicion of raping, assaulting and threatening to kill a woman.

The 20-year-old, who is regarded as one of England’s most talented young footballers, remains under investigation.

Greenwood, from Bradford in West Yorkshire, was arrested on suspicion of rape and assault on Sunday after police saw a woman reporting claims of physical violence and sexual threats on social media. On Tuesday, he was further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and making threats to kill.

The striker, who has played once for England, was suspended from playing for or training with Manchester United until further notice after the allegations.

The sponsor Nike has also moved to distance itself from Greenwood. A statement on Monday read: “We have suspended our relationship with Mason Greenwood. We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.”

Images and allegations were visible on the woman’s Instagram on Sunday morning but have since been deleted.

A United spokesperson said: “Manchester United reiterates its strong condemnation of violence of any kind. As previously communicated, Mason Greenwood will not train with, or play for, the club until further notice.”

The Manchester United Supporters’ Trust (MUST) posted on Twitter on Sunday: “The club has now confirmed that Mason Greenwood will not return to training or play matches until further notice. MUST fully support the decision of the club in this regard.”

Greater Manchester police (GMP), who have not named Greenwood, put out a statement on Wednesday saying: “A 20-year-old man arrested (on Sunday 30 January 2022) on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman has been released on bail pending further investigation.”
