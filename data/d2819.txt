The World Meteorological Organization announced on Monday that it had confirmed two lightning “megaflash” records. The findings, which come after careful data-checking and rigorous certification processes, include one record event that occurred over the Lower 48 states.

On April 29, 2020, a sprawling mass of strong to severe thunderstorms produced a 477.2-mile-long lightning strike over the southern United States. It stretched from near Houston to southeast Mississippi. The record beats a 440-mile-long megaflash that occurred over southern Brazil on Halloween of 2018.

The WMO also identified a world record for the long-lasting lightning flash. It lit up the skies over Uruguay and northern Argentina for 17.1 seconds on June 18, 2020, surpassing a 16.73-second flash recorded over northern Argentina on March 4, 2019.

“These are extraordinary records from single lightning-flash events,” said Professor Randall Cerveny, rapporteur of Weather and Climate Extremes for the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which certified the records. World weather records can take years to officially certify.

“Environmental extremes are living measurements of the power of nature, as well as scientific progress in being able to make such assessments,” Cerveny said. “It is likely that even greater extremes still exist, and that we will be able to observe them as lightning detection technology improves.”

The findings were published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. “Lightning is a major hazard that claims many lives every year,” WMO Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas said. “The findings highlight important public lightning safety concerns for electrified clouds where flashes can travel extremely large distances.”
