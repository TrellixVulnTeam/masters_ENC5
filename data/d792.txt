A city banker who had a witch’s hat left on her desk by drunken male colleagues has been handed more than £2million in compensation for sexual discrimination.

High-flying Stacey Macken, 50, sued French bank BNP Paribas after one boss repeatedly told her ‘not now Stacey’ — a phrase he used so often others copied it.

The £120,000-a year-finance specialist said managers targeted her with unfair treatment when she complained about receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds less than male peers in salary and bonuses over four years.

Ms Macken, who says she has dedicated her life to her career, is to receive £2,081,449 — one of the largest awards ever made by a British tribunal.

It included £51,400 for her ‘pain and suffering’, £35,000 for injury to feelings, and £15,000 in ‘aggravated damages’.

Employment judge Emma Burns criticised Ms Macken’s male bosses for acting ‘spitefully and vindictively’ and increased her compensation because the bank failed to apologise to her.

The London Central tribunal heard the victim, previously a vice president at Deutsche Bank, was hired by BNP Paribas in 2013.

But unbeknown to her, a male peer with the same title and responsibilities was paid £40,000 more.

She said he was also paid £167,000 in bonuses over four years, compared with £33,000 for her.

Ms Macken, of Fulham, west London, claimed she was exposed to sexist behaviour, including the witch’s hat being left on her desk after colleagues were ‘visibly drunk’ at work.

The tribunal heard a testimony from the former PA of one of Ms Macken’s bosses, Matt Pinnock, who detailed this particular incident.

Georgina Chapman said: ‘In October 2013, a large Halloween-style black witch’s hat was left on Stacey Macken’s desk after some of the prime brokerage team, including Matthew Pinnock, had gone drinking at the pub towards the end of the day.

‘Stacey was visibly upset and confided in me that she felt really uncomfortable working with those male colleagues, knowing that one of them had purposefully gone out of their way to leave a witch’s hat on her desk.

The tribunal heard Mr Pinnock also answered the phone to friends with the words ‘hi, f*ckface’ and ‘hi, sexy’ and on one occasion discussed with Miss Mackey how a friend and his wife had engaged in ‘prostitution’ role play.

Another boss, Denis Pihan, was accused of routinely demeaning her by replying ‘not now, Stacey’ when she tried to talk to him.

‘When (she) asked him questions he would tend to say “not now, Stacey”‘, the tribunal heard.

‘He did so often that the (her) colleagues made sarcastic comments about it.

‘In a chat on 21 March 2016 in which Mr Pihan was being discussed one of (them) wrote ‘NOT NOW STACEY:-)”.’

Miss Mackey made repeated internal complaints about her treatment, in particular relating to her pay and bonuses, and eventually took the bank to a tribunal, claiming more than £4 million in compensation and back pay.

She was successful in her claims of sex discrimination, victimisation, and unequal pay.

The tribunal ruled the leaving of a witch’s hat on her desk was an ‘inherently sexist act’ and the regular use of ‘not now, Stacey’ was ‘demeaning’.

At the compensation hearing Judge Burns said: ‘We consider the tribunal panel found that Mr Pinnock and Mr Pihan behaved spitefully and vindictively towards Miss Macken because she had raised concerns about her pay and that they did have a discriminatory motive.

‘We consider the [bank] should apologise more fully from a purely moral perspective, but we decline from ordering it to do this.

‘In our judgement, for an apology to be effective it needs to be genuine and heartfelt rather than ordered… We have taken into account the bank’s failure to apologise when awarding aggravated damages. We consider this is the correct approach in this case.’

Mr Pihan ‘apologised for causing distress’ at the tribunal but ‘did not acknowledge that he personally discriminated against Miss Macken, nor did he apologise for discriminating against her’.

The bank claimed it has now adopted a ‘detailed Gender Strategy and Gender Action Plan’ in response to its poor gender pay gap and is ‘trying to increase the number of women at senior management level’.

Miss Macken, who said her ordeal had an impact on her mental health, is also a qualified accountant who grew up in and was educated in New Zealand.

A tribunal report said of her: ‘She has prioritised her 22 year career in banking over other lifestyle choices. This includes remaining single and not having children.

‘She enjoyed her work and was fulfilled by it. Other than keeping her personal fitness at a high level she pursued no other hobbies or interests.’
