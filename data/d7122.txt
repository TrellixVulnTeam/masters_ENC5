ANTHONY JOSHUA is in talks with Canelo Alvarez's coach Eddy Reynoso as he looks for a new trainer ahead of his rematch with Oleksanrdr Usyk.

Joshua has spent several months reevaluating his coaching squad following defeat to Usyk in September.

He spent time with Reynoso and Canelo in their adopted US training base in San Diego in October.

And Reynoso, who does not speak English, has subsequently revealed an approach to lead Joshua, 32, into his rematch with Usyk, 34, this year.

He told Fight Hub TV: “Well, it’s a question of timing of his next fight. We talked with Eddie Hearn and Joshua’s management and we will see what happens.

“I would love to work with Joshua. Why not? My job is to train fighters, and I will see if I can make it work."

Reynoso has guided Canelo, 31, to world titles in four division and most recently undisputed glory at super-middleweight.

And his impressive stable also consists of heavyweight Andy Ruiz Jr, 32, lightweight star Ryan Garcia, 23, and super-feather champ Oscar Valdez, 31.

But his next focus could be on building Joshua's confidence back and ensuring all of his 6ft 6in and 17st 2lb frame are put to use against Usyk.

Reynoso said: “I think work his distance more, better combinations.

“He has a lot of good traits, a lot of good physical traits, but doesn’t take advantage of them.

“I’m a boxing trainer and willing to work with anyone. Him also. Whoever, it’s just a thing of when the fights will be happening, and we are ready.

“Yeah, I spoke to Joshua and Hearn to see what can be done and we will see what’s next."

Joshua has won Olympic gold and unified world titles as a professional under head coach Rob McCracken.

But ahead of his must-win rematch with Usyk, AJ's promoter Hearn has admitted now could be the time for change.
