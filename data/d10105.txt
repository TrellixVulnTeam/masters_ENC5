WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Lawmakers on Wednesday took steps that could close gaps in data on recycling facilities and programs in the United States and provide funding for pilot programs to improve recycling in underserved communities.

"As part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ... Congress provided unprecedented levels of funding for recycling infrastructure and educational programs," Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Tom Carper said at a committee hearing.
