Numerous Americans refused to trade their half-eaten ice creams, sunglasses, craft beer and face masks for a 1oz gold coin, worth around $1,800, in a stunt by media commentator Mark Dice.

Demonstrating most Americans are unaware of the value of real money, Dice attempts to trade a one-ounce Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin for everyday objects in peoples’ possession – but sadly no one bites.

“Where’d you get that ice cream?” Dice asks one unsuspecting subject, who responds, “At Jojo Creamery.”

“You want to trade it for this one ounce Canadian Maple Leaf?” Dice asks.

“No; this is really good,” she says laughing, not understanding she just turned down the offer of a lifetime.

Accused of attempting to hawk a fake coin, Dice tells the video subjects he’ll go with them to a nearby coin shop to run tests and verify the authenticity of the coin.

Again, the woman refuses the offer, saying, “I’m ok,” and adds the ice cream “is that good.”

The same exact scene plays out throughout the video, with other oblivious Californians who think they know everything refusing to trade knockoff watches, hazy IPA beer, water bottles, half-drank sodas, and even a Covid face mask for the valuable coin produced by the Royal Canadian Mint.

Dice has done similar stunts in the past – offering to sell people a 1oz gold coin for $25, and offering them a choice between a Hershey’s chocolate candy bar and a 10oz silver bar – with similar results.
