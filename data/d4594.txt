SUICIDE is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Leading Causes of Death Report from 2018.

There were "more than two and half times as many suicides" in the US than there were homicides, according to the report.

For people ages 10 and 34, suicide was the "second leading cause of death" and the fourth for individuals ages 35 to 54.

Suicide is a vital health concern in the U.S. It affects all genders, races and ages.
