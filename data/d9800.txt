LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried to change the subject on Wednesday, hoping to replace the public image of himself as a heedless partygoer with that of a confident global statesman and a farsighted nation builder.

The prime minister highlighted a call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. Hours earlier, his government rolled out details of an ambitious, multiyear plan to spread prosperity, or “level up” neglected parts of the Midlands and north of England with more affluent London and the southeast.

But Mr. Johnson’s reset was eclipsed by news that three more Conservative Party lawmakers called for a no-confidence vote in him. It was further evidence that his political support was melting away amid the outcry over alcohol-fueled social gatherings in Downing Street that breached lockdown restrictions during the pandemic.

Mr. Johnson’s hectic day was meant to telegraph both Britain’s relevance on the world stage after Brexit and his commitment to the country’s rust belt, where voters embraced his vow to “get Brexit done” in 2019. Their support propelled his Conservative Party to the greatest landslide since that of Margaret Thatcher in 1987.
