PHILIPPE COUTINHO returned to Brazil's starting lineup with a bang as he scored a brilliant goal in the 4-0 win over Paraguay on Tuesday night.

The Aston Villa loanee was named in Tite's starting XI for the second successive game after not previously playing since October 2020.

Leeds ace Raphinha gave Brazil a first-half lead, before Coutinho had his big moment.

The ex-Liverpool star, 29, looked like he'd never been away, when in the 62nd minute he picked up the ball 25 yards from goal.

Receiving it on the half turn Coutinho then only had one thing on his mind, unleashing a shot at goal.

He rifled a trademark curling effort beyond helpless Paraguay goalkeeper Antony Silva to make it 2-0.

Coutinho's last Brazil start had come against Peru in October 2020, before injuries and a lack of form saw him enter the international wilderness.

His move to Villa appears to have sparked a renaissance, however, and he started against Ecuador - although he was sacrificed early when Emerson Royal saw red - before starting the Paraguay clash.

He was replaced by Bruno Guimaraes to a standing ovation in the 73rd minute, with Newcastle's new star then also impressing his side's fans during his cameo.

After Antony made it 3-0 in the 86th minute, Guimaraes had his moment to shine late on.

The Toon midfielder raced in behind before unselfishly squaring for Real Madrid star Rodrygo to make it four.
