KIM Kardashian turned heads in a skimpy triangle bra and string briefs as she promoted her SKIMS brand online.

The mom-of-four showed off her curves as she posed in the black underwear on her Instagram Stories.

The barely-there outfit was among a selection of lingerie the business woman shared with her social media followers.

Part of her surprise Valentine's Day SKIMS drop, the collection includes silk pyjamas, fitted crop tops and bright pink scoop neck bras.

Kim, 41, looked stunning in the mirror selfie which came hours after she was announced as the glam new face of high end fashion house Balenciaga.

The business mogul has been a dedicated fan of the Spanish brand, stepping out in many notable creations in recent months.

Kim, who is currently dating comedian Pete Davidson, 28, shared photos on Instagram of her promoting Balenciaga's high-fashioned designs, wearing the all-black ensemble.

The model sprawled out on the couch in her $60M Calabasas home to show off her look, pretending to take a picture of herself with her phone.

In separate photos, she showcased her accessories in the photoshoot, including a pair of sock booties, a lime green Le Cagole Shoulder Bag, and silver cutt ear cuff earrings.

She also shared a clip on her Instagram Stories from the ad campaign where she's posing in the outfit while instrumental music plays in the background.

Another photo from the shoot captured the SKIMS founder donning black boots, an overcoat, and sunglasses with a white saddle bag and gold hoops.

Kim has stunned in numerous outfits from the designer as of late, including her now-infamous black masked number that she wore to the Met Gala in September.
