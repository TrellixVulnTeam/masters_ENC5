Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. is set to debut his own NASCAR team, The Money Team Racing, later this month at the Daytona 500.

Mayweather's team secured sponsorship from sunglass company Pit Viper, and Kaz Grala will drive the No. 50 Chevrolet for the retired boxing legend. Mayweather will team with co-owner William Auchmoody, who also will serve as TMT Racing's general manager.
