The health workers’ mission is to provide treatment in remote areas far from health clinics. As they come from the local community they are also more likely to be trusted by their fellow villagers when it comes to thorny issues such as vaccination. The scheme has the added benefit of bringing income and employment to poverty stricken rural areas with few job opportunities.

“I’ve been very impressed with the scheme,” says Robert Yates, director of the global health programme at policy think tank Chatham House. “It's very cost effective and it reaches a lot of people. But the benefits go way beyond the immediate health sector. It creates employment and improves women’s livelihoods. It’s very clever.”

Since the community health scheme officially launched in 2016, it has made startling progress. About 70 per cent of Liberia’s 700,000 rural residents now have access to care and some 1.8 million free screenings and treatments for diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea had been carried out on under fives as of June 2021.

A study published in August found that community health workers now treat 45 per cent of all malaria cases among children under five in those areas, with that figure rising year-on-year. And, crucially, children get treated faster. The number of malaria cases treated in less than 24 hours rose from 12,807 in 2016 to 93,530 in 2020, according to Ministry of Health data.

In Dofah, it can take several hours to walk to the nearest health facility under the energy-sapping Liberian sun. But residents say treatment and diagnosis is now faster, convenient and accessible. “We felt bad when we had to go to the clinic,” says Linda Williams. “It was exhausting if you couldn’t afford the motorbike. Back then I had to rush to the hospital, but now I just go to Flomo’s house.”
