Having been handed a favourable path into the final four, Egypt offer Cameroon their greatest test yet. Though Carlos Queiroz’s side are not without their issues, the manner in which they’ve improved as the tournament has progressed has been impressive.

Here’s everything you need to know.

The AFCON semi-final is scheduled for a 7pm GMT kick-off time on Thursday February 3, 2022.

The Olembe Stadium in Yaounde will host it.
