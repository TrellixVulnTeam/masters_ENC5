A series of high-level talks are in the works to avert the threat of war as Russian troops mass by the tens of thousands on the borders of Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's top security demands but said Moscow is willing to talk more to ease tensions. The comments were his first on the standoff in more than a month.

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson landed in Kyiv in a show of support for the country against Russian aggression yesterday and will talk with Mr Putin later today.

Here we break down how the crisis reached this point and what could be next.

Up to 130,000 Russian troops, alongside 1,200 tanks, fighter jets and long-range missile batteries have massed on Ukraineâ€™s eastern border. The troop build-up has sparked the biggest crisis in East-West ties since the Cold War.

Russia put forward a list of security demands including a guarantee that Ukraine will never be allowed to join Nato and that alliance forces pull back in Eastern European countries that joined after 1997.
