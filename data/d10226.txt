SWANTON, Vt. (AP) — Two Vermont men are facing misdemeanor charges after they abandoned what is described as a “junk boat” on the Missisquoi River in the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in Swanton, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.

The two men are charged with abandoning and discarding personal property and dumping garbage, debris, and refuse on a National Wildlife Refuge.

Prosecutors say one of the men bought a boat last summer, stripped the engine and then sold it. Rather than paying to dispose of the boat properly, he got another man to help him tow the boat to the river where it was set adrift, prosecutors said.

The next day United States Fish and Wildlife personnel discovered the boat. The engine was gone, but the gas tank contained more than 4 gallons of gas.

It cost federal officials nearly $1,100 for the proper disposal of the boat and associated administrative costs.

The two men, who are due to appear in federal court later this month, do not yet have lawyers.
