We start today with irony. While many members of the so-called ‘freedom convoy’ came to Ottawa demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s head over COVID-19 mandates and restrictions, in a quick turn of events, it’s Conservative leader Erin O’Toole leadership that is now at risk.

He’s vowing to fight to hold on to the helm of the party after a third of caucus signed a letter to force a secret ballot vote on his leadership as early as tomorrow, and today supporters within the party said he should stay on in the face of efforts to oust him. A new group called Majority Committee has also emerged and launched a website to champion O’Toole’s strategy as what’s best for the party.

A vote by 50 per cent plus one of the 119 sitting Tory MPs would force him to step aside immediately. Last night O’Toole said on social media that he welcomes the vote. “I’m not going anywhere and I’m not turning back,” he wrote. “It’s time for a reckoning. To settle this in caucus. Right here. Right now. Once and for all.”

In case you’re keeping count, whoever replaces O’Toole will be the fifth leader of the Tories since Trudeau was elected leader of the Liberals in 2013. Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he won’t be going after O’Toole’s job if he’s ousted. “No, I have my hands full,” Ford said during a media conference in Ajax. “I love being premier of this province. We’re going to build this province and I’m going to continue leading this province. That’s my job.”
