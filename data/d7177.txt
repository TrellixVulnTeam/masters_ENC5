THIS former Champions League winner looks unrecognisable after coming out of retirement to play in his native country of Ghana.

The 37-year-old is better known for his trophy-laden spell at Inter Milan.

Sulley Muntari won eight major titles with Inter between 2008 and 2012, including two Serie A titles and a Champions League.

The 84-cap former Ghana international retired from professional football in 2019 after an unsuccessful spell with Albacete.

But after three years out, Muntari has signed for Ghana Premier League champions Hearts of Oak.

Muntari will see out the remainder of the season with the local team.

And he has ditched his usual short hair for a longer look with a beard.

The former Portsmouth ace and FA Cup winner isn't the only high profile former Ghanaian to return to his native country to play.
