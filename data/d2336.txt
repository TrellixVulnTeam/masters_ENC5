Former President Trump threw his support behind patriotic Canadian truckers who were protesting draconian Covid-19 related inoculation mandates that continue to afflict the nation.

The former President praised participants of the convoy as heroes who are “doing more to defend American freedom than our own leaders by far.”

“The Canadian truckers, you’ve been reading about it… They’re resisting bravely these lawless mandates. They’re doing more to defend American freedom than our own leaders, by far. And we want those great Canadian truckers to know that we are with them all the way,” said Trump.

“We want those great Canadian truckers to know that we are with them all the way,” he told a crowd of supporters in Conroe, 40 miles north of Houston.

Trump also slammed Joe Biden for his administration’s arguably unconstitutional Covid-19 inoculation mandates forcing the jab on federal contractors, businesses with 100 or more employees, healthcare workers that work at places receiving federal funding, and the military.

Consequences threatened against the protesting truckers by the Canadian government appear to be severe, with Daily Mail UK reporting that the province of Nova Scotia has threatened $10,000 fines for anyone gathering on highways in order to protest against the Covid-19 mandates.

Justin Trudeau appears to be largely fearful of the unrest in the nation, with many outlets now reporting that the Canadian Prime Minister and his family left their home in Ottawa amid security concerns. Trudeau also announced that he was quarantining himself for 5 days after testing negative for Covid-19, with some speculating that he was making a bluff in order to hide from the public amid massive political pressure.
