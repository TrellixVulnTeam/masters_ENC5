A KIDDERMINSTER couple's brewing company has launched a limited edition beer to celebrate the Harrier's upcoming FA Cup game.

Dan Lawson and his wife Samantha, who live close to Aggborough Stadium, produced their 'Birdie' pale ale out of their nano brewery garden shed.

Mr Lawson, head brewer at Copper Beech Brewing Company, says he's a massive Harriers fan and wanted to do something special to mark the club's FA Cup fifth round match against Premier League giants West Ham.

The 35-year-old says he goes to the Harriers' home and away games as much as possible.

Mrs Lawson said: "He is so thrilled and excited by their incredible position in the current FA Cup, he decided to create a limited edition version of one of our best selling beers to mark the occasion.

"Our pale ale, Birdie, was actually inspired by time spent in the Harriers Arms before the matches and so it seemed the perfect beer to give a 'boys in red' inspired makeover."

It's an American Pale Ale with hints of grape fruit, pine and exotic oats.

Mr Lawson said: "I've been a Harriers fan since the day I got here. It's great having the ground a two minute walk away.

"I can't go because Sam's due to give birth in two weeks, but I'll be watching it on the TV.

"I'm sure there are plenty of people who didn't get tickets. Everyone can drink a beer while watching it on the TV."

Producing only 150 cans for public sale, the beer is available to buy via the Copper Beech Brewing Company website up to 6pm on Thursday, February 3.

The cans will be delivered just in time for their 5th round match against West Ham on Saturday, February 5.
