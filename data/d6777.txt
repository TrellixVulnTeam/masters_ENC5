Our government is working overtime to try to inject every citizen with experimental gene therapy that has proven to be entirely ineffective at protecting anyone from COVID-19 infection.

The leftist-run mainstream media outlets, many of which run paid advertisements for pharmaceutical corporations, are dedicated to inundating the public with the tyrannical Covid programming.

Media bots are now employing the same grimey campaign tactics they’ve used for years used against Republican voters to delegitimize and demonize anyone who opposes absurd, totalitarian Covid mandates.

Approximately 30,000 Americans traveled from across the country to “defeat” Covid mandates in Washington DC last week.

Attendees included physicians, attorneys, grassroots organizers, athletes, musicians and activists of all ages comprising arguably the most politically diverse crowd to ever gather on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

But if you turn on the TV or rely on the Covid enterprise for news, you’ll watch highly paid fake news peddlers selling fear, attempting to convince you only a handful of “fringe,” “dangerous,” “crazy,” “conspiracy theorists” and an “extremists” oppose medical tyranny and hazardous experimental Covid shots.

In interviews with The Gateway Pundit, over a dozen attendees of the rally — including guest speakers Dr. Paul Alexander, the Chief Scientific Officer with The Unity Project and former Former WHO consultant, Dr. Peter McCullough, internist, cardiologist, epidemiologist, Dr. Ben Marble, founder of MyFreeDoctor.com and family health specialist, former NBA player and talk show host Kwame Brown, BET reality TV star Angela-Stanton King and civil rights attorney Tricia Lindsey — detail the danger of vaccine mandates and slam the media for constantly disseminating outright lies.
