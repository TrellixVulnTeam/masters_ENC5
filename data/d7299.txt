Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Fans might not be able to buy tickets to attend live Olympic events this month in Beijing, but NBC and its broadcast partners will air a record 2,800+ hours of 2022 Winter Games coverage from Wednesday through Feb. 20.

U.S. viewers won't get much sleep if they want to catch the action live, with many events taking place in the early morning because Beijing is 13 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time.
