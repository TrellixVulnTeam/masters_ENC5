Even if you’re in a relationship, you might find yourself feeling cynical towards the Hallmark associations of the day of love. But we are encouraging to put your skepticism to one side for one year and one year only.

After the lack of celebrations in all part of our lives over the last few years, we are taking any excuse to pop open the Champers and show your loved ones how much you mean to them.

If you’re looking for a gift, you don’t want to disappoint. There’s high expectations associated with February 14 and if you show up with something lacklustre, it may have the opposite effect and be perceived something less than your true feelings.

So whether you’re tentatively dating, a lockdown relationship yet to celebrate a proper Valentine’s Day or you’ve been together longer than you can remember, consult our fool proof gift list below. You’ll find options for every budget and all tastes – from the naughty to the nice.
