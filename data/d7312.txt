Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Dallas Mavericks guard Tim Hardaway Jr. underwent surgery for a broken bone in his left foot Tuesday, the team announced.

Hardaway broke the fifth metatarsal bone in his foot during the Mavs' 130-92 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Jan. 25. He was helped off the court with under eight minutes left in the second quarter during that loss to Golden State.
