Deputies from the Summit County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) received a report around 11 a.m. that a woman had been shot during a hunting accident that took place near mile marker 178 off of I-80, according to KUTV.

The woman reportedly got onto a stationary side-by-side ATV which as that point a hunting rifle misfired and hit her in the pelvic area, according to Fox 13 Salt Lake City.

Emergency responders attempted to perform lifesaving measures, but she was pronounced dead on the scene before a medical helicopter arrived, according to the outlet.

“Based on what we’re seeing and the information we have at this point, it appears that it was a hunting accident,” SCSO Lt. Andrew Wright said, according to KSL.com.

While authorities are calling it a hunting accident, the incident is still under investigation, according to the outlet.
