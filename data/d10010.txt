However, the move will break a key Tory manifesto pledge not to raise income taxes, NI or VAT and comes alongside a five-year freeze in NI thresholds, as well as the personal allowance for income tax, announced in the Budget last March – a "stealth tax" that will net the state close to £20bn in additional revenue by 2026.

From April 2022, employees, freelancers and companies will pay more and the highest earners will pay the most, with someone on an annual income of £150,000 paying £1,755 more a year, according to calculations from tax firm Blick Rothenberg.

It does not affect anyone claiming the state pension. However, from April 2023, pensioners will pay 1.25pc National Insurance contributions on income earned through working.

However, NI is not payable on investment income, meaning wealthy landlords or those living off of dividends from investment portfolios are exempt.

How much more tax will I pay?

Someone on £100,000 will pay £1,130 more, while an £80,000 earner will pay an extra £880 a year. Those on salaries of £60,000, £40,000 and £20,000 will be forced to hand over an additional £630, £380 and £130 a year, respectively.

The rates on "class 1" contributions which employees pay on earnings in excess £9,568 a year will rise to 13.25pc from 12pc, while the "upper earnings rate" which kicks in on earnings of more than £50,270 a year will increase to 3.25pc, from 2pc.

The self-employed pay slightly lower rates "class 4" contributions. The rate they pay will rise to 10.25pc, from 9pc on annual earnings of more than £9,568 and at 3.25pc on anything more than £50,270, up from 2pc.

Some lower-earning freelancers pay "class 2" NI annual earnings of £6,515 up to the class four threshold, at a rate of £3.05 a week.

The rate on employer contributions paid by companies will rise to 15.05pc, up from 13.8pc.

The levy increase will not apply to "class 2" contributions for low earning freelancers or voluntary "class 3" contributions.

Employees and employers can reduce the amount they amount of NI they pay via salary sacrifice schemes, where workers pay for work-place benefits such as loans for season tickets or bicycles for travelling to the office, or by upping how much they pay into workplace pension schemes.

Salary sacrifice schemes also exist for car lease arrangements, private health care and dental insurance, although such perks are usually classed as a taxable benefit and subject to income duties.
