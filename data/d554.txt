The British star, 29, turned her talents to acting, starring in Suicide Squad alongside Margot Robbie before embarking on a music career.

She has previously described herself as pansexual and bisexual but said last year that how she sexually identifies frequently changes.

The actress also said struggles with her sexuality left her with suicidal thoughts.

Speaking about the lack of LGBTQ+ role models growing up, Delevingne told Harper’s Bazaar UK: "I do think I would have hated myself less, I would have not been so ashamed, if I’d had someone.

"The one thing I’m happy about growing up queer and fighting it and hiding it is, it gives me so much fire and drive to try to make people’s lives easier in some way by talking about it."

In the past, she has dated Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson and musician St Vincent.

Now she said on romance: "I really value my privacy so much".

Delevingne also told the magazine she has dreams of motherhood but she is not ready yet.

"I want to have babies. But not yet,” she said. "I buy children’s clothes for my future child who doesn’t exist.

"Baby shoes really get me - they break my heart. I went shopping the other day and I bought these tiny Air Jordans, which are purple and they have a lion on them.”

It comes after the star told the Sunday Times last week that her sisters, Chloe, 37, and Poppy, 35, did their best to be there for her growing up.

“Growing up as a queer child was isolating and hard to navigate at times. My sisters did their best to be there for me but it was something I had to go through myself to truly know who I was,” she said.

“I’m still on that journey and will continue to be for the rest of my life.”

The March issue of Harper’s Bazaar UK is on sale from February 2.
