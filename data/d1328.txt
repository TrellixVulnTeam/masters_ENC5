A teen girl whose remains were found in a bath full of acid married the man accused of killing her just weeks before, it has been reported.

Aspiring surgeon Aminah Hayat, 19, was reportedly left dissolving in the corrosive liquid for 24 hours in the flat she shared with boyfriend and suspected killer Meraj Zafar in Sydney, Australia.

Police believe she was killed between 12pm and 5pm on Saturday, one day before they smashed the door in to find the horrific scene.

Ms Hayat, a Bangladeshi national, is said to have moved in with Zafar six months ago and tied the knot just weeks before her death, according to Daily Mail Australia.

In images taken from social media, the pair are seen holding each other in a loving embrace.

Ms Hayat's heartbroken parents, who were reportedly unhappy with their plans to wed, said their daughter cut off all contact with them after she moved in with Zafar, according to the Daily Mail.

In an emotional interview with 7News, her dad Abu Hayat said: "I love my daughter. I want my daughter (back)."

Police initially launched a manhunt after Zafar was spotted fleeing the scene in his truck.

However he handed himself in to cops yesterday and was charged with the young woman's murder.

Speaking on behalf of the suspected killer today, his lawyer Mohamad Sakr said he has been left "distraught" by his first night locked up behind bars.

Local residents said Zafar told neighbours he was from Pakistan but that he spoke English very well.

Ali Safari, who lives next door, said Ms Hayat was often "smiling" and came across as "pleasant" whenever they saw each other.

He told the Daily Mail: 'She was always playing music. She was quiet, I never spoke with her.'

Zafar's lawyer refused to comment on a number of questions, including whether the victim was married to his client or whether they were just boyfriend and girlfriend.

He said: "He is someone who is in a relationship with her'.
