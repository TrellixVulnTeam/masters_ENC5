Azalea, who revealed to Vogue in 2015 that she had recently undergone breast implant surgery, told Seventeen later that year she had also been under the knife for a nose job. "I'm not denying it. Denying it is lame," she said. Azalea also acknowledged the psychological element of contemplating cosmetic surgery.

"Plastic surgery is an emotional journey," she said. "It's no easy feat to live with your flaws and accept yourself â€” and it's no easy feat to change yourself. Either way you look at it, it's a tough journey. There are things that I didn't like about myself that I changed through surgery. There are other things I dislike but I've learned to accept."

"It's important to remember you can't change everything," she added. "You can never be perfect." The rapper has more recently been accused of Blackfishing due to changes in her skin tone.
