Senegal struck three times in the last 20 minutes to book their place in Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations final as they beat Burkina Faso 3-1.

Abdou Diallo scored from close range after a corner in the 70th minute for the opening goal, before a strike from Bamba Dieng doubled Senegal’s lead six minutes later following great work from Sadio Mane.

Blati Toure pulled a goal back though, to make it 2-1 in the 82nd minute, as he managed to divert an effort past Edouard Mendy with his knee.

But Sadio Mane put the result beyond doubt with a breakaway goal five minutes later to restore Senegal’s two-goal advantage, as Burkina Faso were ruthlessly exposed having thrown players forward in search of an equaliser.

Senegal, who were runners-up at the last tournament in 2019, will meet hosts Cameroon or Egypt in the AFCON final, as they once again try and lift the trophy for a first time.
