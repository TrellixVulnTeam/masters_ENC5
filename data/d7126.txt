BARCELONA finally announced the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - two years after manager Xavi Hernandez warned them against the transfer.

The 32-year-old forward penned his deal at the Nou Camp only 48 hours after Arsenal cancelled his contract to enable him to sign on a free transfer.

Aubameyang has agreed a contract until June 2025 with a buyout clause of £84million placed in the deal.

And there is also an option for him to depart at the end of next season.

Barcelona have been linked with Aubameyang several times over recent years.

But when speculation mounted over a move back in 2020, legendary midfielder and current Barca boss told the LaLiga giants NOT to buy him.

Explaining why the Gabonese international would not be a good fit in Catalonia, he said: “[Sadio] Mane and Aubemayang can kill you in open space.

“But Barcelona need players who know how to move in small spaces.

“I am thinking about a player who would adapt to Barcelona and it’s not easy to find one.

“Samuel Eto’o was perfect as is Luis Suarez right now.”

Barcelona have now posted their first official clip of Aubameyang in their club's colours as well as his medical.

The striker said: "I’m very proud, especially because my family is Spanish as well on my mother’s side.



"I’m just really proud and happy to be here



"My main goal is to help the team and do everything I can to bring the team back to the Champions League."

Xavi secured the signing of Manchester City's Ferran Torres in January but had to let Philippe Coutinho leave for Aston Villa on loan in order to register the winger.

He also brought in Adama Traore on loan with Dani Alves returning on a free to the Nou Camp.
