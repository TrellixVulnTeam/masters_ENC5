The catchphrase that long outlived “Poltergeist II,” the forgettable 1986 sequel to the memorable 1982 movie, now (the horror!) applies to the decade that followed, the subject of Chuck Klosterman’s new book, “The Nineties.” Parsing catchphrases and other pop-culture flotsam, he has built a sturdy publishing career.

A prolific essayist, novelist and several other “-ists” (he used to write The Ethicist column for The New York Times), Klosterman is turning his attention not to poltergeists but, yet again, the zeitgeist — specifically to a shrugging, liminal period he believes began in earnest, or in irony, with the release of Nirvana’s album “Nevermind” in September of 1991. This event of rock ‘n’ roll history he compares to a plane representing the noisy ’80s on autopilot crashing into a mountain. (A perhaps injudicious metaphor, considering that Klosterman thinks the ‘90s officially ended with the collapse of the Twin Towers.)

The era has lately been a source of curiosity, its aesthetic mined by digital natives who marvel at the freedom of a world where people partied and presented themselves without being haunted by their online shadows. “Every new generation tends to be intrigued by whatever generation existed 20 years earlier,” Klosterman writes. This particular look back has special romance, since, as he writes mock-portentously, “The internet was coming. The internet was coming. The internet was coming.” But the internet as we know it wasn’t quite there yet.

The 1990s were the twilight of a millennium and a monoculture (such as it was); the last time we (whoever “we” were) seemed to be on the same page: one we could crinkle in our hands. Judging from the way things are going so far in the 21st century, it might have also been the last time Americans could reasonably carve up history into digestible 10-year chunks, a practice that goes back at least as far as the Gay ’90s — the 1890s.
