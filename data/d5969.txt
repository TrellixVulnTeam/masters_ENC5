Bronx Supreme Court Justice David Lewis tossed convictions against 133 defendants in cases in which former New York Police Department detective Joseph Franco testified. Franco has been indicted on 26 counts of felony perjury. Last year, the Brooklyn district attorney dismissed 93 other cases which relied on Franco's testimony.
