The attempts by D.C. barbarians to push us into war over Ukraine has been met with grass roots condemnation. See The Ukraine Crisis is More Fake than Saddam Hussein's WMD. Their antics, much like their medical Faucism and mandates, are now facing new degrees of resistance and activation from the population. People have had enough, from either party. Just look at the support for the trucker convoys! It's only going to grow.

Now is the time to end the uniparty of neo-cons and neo-libs, and run the barbarians out of power. Now is the time to restore the American system and reclaim our sovereignty. As Lincoln would have said, first the barbarians, and then the British.

Think it's impossible? If you did, you don't anymore.
