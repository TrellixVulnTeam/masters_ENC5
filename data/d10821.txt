Some are superstars. Some are coaches. Some you see on TV every morning. Some you may not know. They have gold medals, Super Bowl wins, Ivy League degrees.

They are all part of USA TODAY Sports' inaugural ranking of the "50 Most Influential Black People in Sports.” The list was constructed by USA TODAY Sports Race and Inequality Editor Mike Freeman and members of the Sports staff. Other consultants included historians and journalists outside of USA TODAY. It has been limited to people who are alive and whose impact is on American sports.

How to define what makes an individual influential? First of all, we have emphasized present-day influence. In other words, while Bill Russell is a remarkable and historic presence, he didn't make the list. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, still a prominent voice and activist, did make it. Of course, influence goes beyond sports or solely what happens on the field. It can be money and power, or social media presence, or bravery, or fame, or being a singular example in a sport or position where there are few people who look like them. Or, it is all of those things.

The list isn’t meant to cause controversy. Instead, it's intended to acknowledge the strength, reach and depth of Blacks in sports during Black History Month. How do we do that? By counting to 50.
