In a remarkable effort to Alinksy the voices of those who oppose the Canadian government COVID restrictions and mandates, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claims the truck drivers in Ottawa are stealing food from the homeless while flying racist flags.

This entire tweet thread statement by the Canadian Prime Minister is just bizarre in the extreme.

The need for control is a reaction to fear. However, this type of lashing out, an effort to create a completely alternate reality of actual conditions on the ground in Ottawa, is indicative of a profoundly unstable person. These are the extreme messages one would see from a person carrying pathological traits of borderline personality disorder.

Perhaps, due to the ideological nature of the echo chamber around him, this may be the first time Trudeau has witnessed a gathering of people who do not agree with his worldview. Obviously, he doesnâ€™t know how to handle what is in front of him.

Something is very unstable, creepy to a level of visible discomfort, in the way Prime Minister Trudeau is attempting to message to his national audience. Put another way, this guy is losing his s**t, in public. This level of public breakdown should be the number one story on the world stage.
