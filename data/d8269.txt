Anthony Mangnall and Sir Gary Streeter were the latest MPs to publicly withdraw their support for the Prime Minister and submit a letter of no confidence.

It comes hours after Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said it was “time to resolve” the ‘partygate’ issue and admitted the scandal was dragging the Conservative party into an “ugly place”.

He told Sky News that he wanted to break the “holding pattern” the party is currently in, claiming it was “horrible for all MPs to have to defend this to the British public”.

Fresh from his one-day trip to Ukraine, Mr Johnson refused to confirm whether he would resign if fined by police for breaching Covid rules.
