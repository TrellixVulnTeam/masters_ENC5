A man suspected of assaulting a police officer was arrested after an hours-long standoff in Boyle Heights on Tuesday.

Officers initially responded around 1:30 p.m. to a report of a man with a gun in the 1500 block of Pleasant Avenue, said Officer Drake Madison, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.

The assault occurred as officers were setting up a perimeter, Madison said. The spokesman said he did not have information on whether the man shot at officers or used some other kind of weapon.

After the assault, the man barricaded himself inside a building, possibly an apartment complex, Madison said.

SWAT officers were called to the scene, he said.

The man was taken into custody without incident around 6 p.m., Madison said.

Further information, including the manâ€™s name, age, city of residence and possible charges, was not available Tuesday night.
