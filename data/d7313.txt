Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., is suing North Carolina elections officials over an effort to remove his name from the ballot in the upcoming 2022 election.

Cawthorn filed the lawsuit in federal court Monday against the North Carolina State Board of Elections, contending it does not have the authority to remove his name from election ballots.
