It looks like the Washington Football Team will be called the Commanders going forward.

A major name change announcement is coming at some point Wednesday for WFT, but it looks like fans won’t have to wait at all to find out the team’s new name. (RELATED: David Hookstead Is The True King In The North When It Comes To College Football)

In a video tweeted by Brad Freitas, the team appeared to have already hung a Commanders sign in FedEx Stadium.

There has been chatter about WFT becoming the Washington Commanders for a long time, and there have been clues sprinkled throughout the internet.

However, I’d say this is the biggest sign that the Commanders is the name that has been chosen. There’s no way WTF hung this sign for the hell of it.

Now, what do I think about the name? I think it’s weak as all hell. The Commanders doesn’t get my blood pumping at all.

It’s among the most generic names possible for an NFL franchise. It doesn’t move the needle at all. I’d rather the team just stayed the Washington Football Team.

At least being the WFT has a classic and nostalgic feel to it.
