A GROUP of die-hard Harriers fans will be travelling overseas to witness their beloved club take on West Ham in the FA Cup on Saturday.

Nearly a thousand miles away from Aggborough Stadium, an admiration for the Sixth-tier Kidderminster Harriers has grown in Norway over the last few years.

The Harriers of Norway is a group who are passionate about non-league football, with Premier League and glamour clubs leaving them unimpressed.

"It’s more fun because it’s grassroots football – there’s much harder tackles, not much diving," said Stig Morten from the group.

The group, based in Aalesund, also has its very own purpose built Aggborough stand.

A total of nine members of the Harriers of Norway group will be flying over to Worcestershire to witness the crucial fourth round fixture.

Mr Morten believes another upset could be on the cards.

He added: “It might happen. We have got good form for the season. If we can just sit tight, don’t concede, and score one goal. That’s the best scenario I can think of.

“It’s massive for the club. We love Kidderminster Harriers."
