Police searched a school in the northern German city of Hamburg on Tuesday as an armed youth may have entered the building, they said.

Police said it was not clear whether the armed person had entered the school in Hamburg's Jenfeld district or was only passing by. A spokesperson for the police said the search was still ongoing, with special units, and that no gunshots had been heard or reported so far.

Hamburg police said: "A youth armed with a gun is said to have entered the school building. It is not clear whether the gunman observed actually entered the building or just walked "in the direction of the school building" and then perhaps past the school. As a precaution, the school building is currently being searched by special units."
