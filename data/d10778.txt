Feb. 2 (UPI) -- Thousands of flights were canceled and about 100 million people in the United States were under some type of severe weather warning Wednesday as forecasters expected a large swath of the country to see storms over the next couple days.

Winter storm alerts have been issued from New Mexico to Maine as meteorologists expect a mix of snow, rain, sleet and ice over a span of about 2,000 miles. By Wednesday evening ice storm warnings were also put in effect from eastern Arkansas through central Kentucky.
