Seth Rogen plays the revenge seeking electrician Rand Gauthier in the series.

Gauthier was an electrician who made a choice that had a lasting impact on the people around him.

His choices resulted in the world knowing about Pamela Anderson's sex tape with Tommy Lee.

Lee believes that one of the contractors who were working on the renovation of his London home where the pair were staying removed the safe that contained the famous tape.

Gauthier, 65, was in fact working at the home at the time of the theft and has been the blame for allegedly stealing the sex tape from the rocker's home.

Where is Rand Gauthier now?

The former couple's tape was released to the then-new World Wide Web in 1996.

Now about 26 years later Gauthier is living a rather normal suburban life.

According to Digital Spy the electrician is "growing marijuana" in Santa Rosa, California.

In 2014 he spoke to Rolling Stone and said that he was happy to have contributed something to the world.

"It was cute. They're in love and a couple and they're just having fun with each other, and I think that's great.

"I'm jealous. I wish I had something like that."

There are in fact also no publicly available photos of him, as he has remained out of the public eye for much of the time since the scandal.

Who is in the cast of Pam and Tommy?

The Hulu original series will star Lily James as Pamela Anderson, along with Sebastian Stan playing Mötley Crüe's Tommy Lee.

The show also includes Park and Recreation's Nick Offerman who appears as Uncle Miltie.

Taylor Schilling is also starring opposite Rogen as the role of Gauthier’s wife and pornographic actress Erica Gauthier.

The trailer for Pam and Tommy premiered back on November 17, 2021.
