Paris is, after all, a moveable feast.

Paris Jackson appeared to be sporting a large hickey on her neck Wednesday as she was snapped at New York City’s John F. Kennedy Airport with older brother, Prince Jackson, and younger brother, Bigi Jackson.

Paris, 23, Prince, 24 and Bigi (fka Blanket), 19, were all snapped together at JFK as they headed out of the city following Tuesday’s opening night performance of “MJ: The Musical” on Broadway, based on the career of their father, the late Michael Jackson.

While Paris’ curly hair draped past her shoulders on the red carpet, her neck and the unmissable mark were highly visible as she walked through the terminal, hair high in a messy chignon.

It’s uncertain whether or not the mark was covered with make-up during the show, or if the “Let Down” singer acquired it following the curtain call.

She wore a burgundy mask in the snaps, as well as a brown coat, green leggings and Dr. Martens to the airport, in high contrast to her Broadway look: a chic red and gold wrap dress, neutral boots and colorful accessories.

Brother Prince wore a camouflage windbreaker and grey sweatpants while Bigi wore a “2020” printed hoodie and black Nike sweats, ditching the suits they donned the night before.

The only daughter of the “King of Pop” was said to have been incredibly moved by the production, wiping away tears while resting her head on one of her brothers’ shoulders during an emotional duet of “I’ll Be There” in the show’s first act.

Theatergoers also claim she was on the edge of her seat during the second act before being escorted out with her brothers a bit early, just before the show wrapped to a standing ovation.

A rep for Paris Jackson did not immediately return our request for comment.
