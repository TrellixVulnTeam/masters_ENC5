Carl Jung once said, “The meeting of 2 personalities is like the contact of 2 chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.” That’s why we see people who are in relationships do things that they’ve never done before because they know their partner will be happy. They go to great lengths to keep each other’s love burning and this is because of their unconditional bond.
