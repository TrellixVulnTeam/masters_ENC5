TOUR DE FRANCE winner Egan Bernal is set to undergo spinal surgery as he remains in intensive care following his crash into a parked bus.

The Colombian, 25, suffered the horrific collision while training in his home country last week and was lucky to survive the terrifying ordeal.

The Ineos Grenadiers rider was left with fractures in his right leg and kneecap, along with a collapsed lung.

Doctors performed a host of surgeries on him before he posted on social media from his hospital bed.

And he later said: "Having had a 95% chance of becoming a paraplegic and nearly losing my life doing what I love to do most... Today I want to thank God, @ClinicaUsabana, all his specialists for doing the impossible, my family, @mafemotas and all of you.

"I'm still in the ICU waiting for more surgeries but trusting in God everything will be fine."

Now, as reported by Marca, he will undergo cervical spine surgery on his back on Wednesday.

The hospital are hoping this will give him the best possible chance of rehabilitation.

Quotes from the hospital read: "This intervention will favor his rehabilitation process.

"We advance with the patient in all his recovery processes, confident in his prompt improvement.

"We will be reporting the postoperative evolution of the athlete at the time the procedure is finished."

Bernal claimed the 2019 Tour de France at the age of just 22 - making him the youngest winner of the race since 1909.

After a difficult 18 months suffering with back injuries, he then went on to win the Giro d'Italia last year.

Bernal received well wishes from a number of his teammates, including 2020 Giro champion Tao Geoghegen Hart.

The Brit said: "We are all hoping you are ok @Eganbernal. So scary to read this news.

"A sad reminder how dangerous our training can be."
