ABC’s The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg was slammed for saying the Holocaust was “not about race.”

Goldberg made the outrageous comment during part of a discussion with her co-hosts over the alleged banning of a book in a Tennessee school about the Holocaust.

Hours later and realizing the onslaught of backlash, Goldberg issued a statement:

Management at ABC and Disney are silent about Goldberg’s anti-Semitic comment because she is a black liberal female and can get away with anything.

Anyone else making such an outrageous comment would have been fired immediately.
