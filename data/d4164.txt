Arizona State Representative Walt Blackman and his wife, Kristie, have targeted The Gateway Pundit correspondent Jordan Conradson with vicious smears against Conradson’s character.

TGP reported that RINO Walt Blackman was against decertification of Arizona’s fraudulent 2020 election claiming, “There is nothing in the Constitution that says that we can decertify.”

Blackman is either wrong or not telling the truth.

The U.S. Constitution grants plenary power to the State Legislature to oversee elections and choose or withdraw their state’s electors. The House and Senate can decertify with a joint resolution.

Just minutes after this article was published, Blackman called Conradson to demand that the article be taken down.

Blackman claimed that what Conradson wrote was untrue, realized he was mistaken, then pledged to post a Facebook live video to clarify his stance on decertification or nullification of the fraudulent 2020 election. Blackman quietly did a live stream, but he did not publish the video to his page.

Blackman refused to comment on why he removed the video.

Last Friday, The Gateway Pundit reported that Kristie sent multiple crazy texts to Conradson for hours with no response.

One of Kristie’s texts said, “I have a surprise for you.”

This is not even Conradson’s phone number.

Despite having his number and knowing these texts did not come from Conradson, Kristie spread this lie in an attempt to defame his character.

Was this the surprise she had planned? Were these messages even real, or was this just her plan to get back at Conradson for his work?

Kristie Blackman refused to comment on the racist accusations saying, “don’t call me again.”

On Saturday, Conradson called the phone number and reached Walt Blackman’s voicemail.
