Irruption years, in which many of the birds are spotted south, are believed to be linked to arctic food sources, researchers say. When there’s a lot of food, specifically lemmings — a hamsterlike rodent that the owls feast on and male owls may even present to a female in courtship — there tends to be more fledged owls. Those owls are then able to widely disperse, at times as far south as Texas.
