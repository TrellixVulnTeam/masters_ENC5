Princess Diana's childhood home will not go to either of her two sons, Prince William or Prince Harry, and will instead go to their cousin.

Louis Spencer, 27, is Diana's nephew who was just a tot when the Princess of Wales tragically died in Paris is now set to inherit her childhood home.

Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, has four children and his youngest is heir to the 13,500 Althorp estate in Northamptonshire where Princess Diana is buried.

As reported in The Mirror, estates going to the oldest male heirs is part of a longstanding tradition in the Spencer family, despite many royal fans being shocked William and Harry won't inherit the estate.

The heir is one of six siblings - Lady Kitty Spencer, 31, Lady Amelia Spencer, 29, Lady Eliza Spencer, 29, Samuel Aitken, 18 and Edmund Spencer, 18.

Louis grew up in Cape Town before coming back to the UK to study at the University of Edinburgh and is described as being a 'very private' person.

According to the Telegraph, a source close to Louis told the publication last year: "He’s super private and gets on quietly with his thing. He’s a very talented actor and, I think, will be a brilliant one.

"You’d like him. He’s very low-key and genuine, decent and kind – and tall."

The aristocrat is also a budding actor with Jonathan Shalit, chairman of the InterTalent agency, speaking very highly of him.

Jonathon said: “In terms of judging his potential there’s what he looks like and his family name... The Americans will love him, in particular. He’ll get some good roles from his name alone. And he’s good looking.”

Princess Diana grew up between the impressive Althorp estate boasting 90 rooms and a portrait gallery, and Sandringham Estate.

Following Princess Diana's death in 1997, she was buried on a small island on the estate in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake.
