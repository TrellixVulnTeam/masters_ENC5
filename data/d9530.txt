Joe Biden on Wednesday announced he will relaunch Barack Obama’s ‘Cancer Moonshot’ plan to reduce cancer deaths.

Dr. Jill joined Biden and delivered remarks: “We can stop cancer in its tracks,” she said.

Joe Biden spoke about his late son Beau and thanked the oncologist who treated Beau before his death.

Anything to distract from the horrible jobs report and multiple crises – now Joe Biden is going to cure cancer.

After the brief remarks, Dr. Jill jumped into action and grabbed feeble Joe’s hand so she could carefully lead him off stage.
