PORN star Holly Parker has died at the age of 30, according to reports.

The transgender adult entertainer, who starred in dozens of movies, passed away on Monday, her close friend Brooke Zanell said.

A cause of death has not yet been revealed as investigations continue.

Zanell posted on Facebook: “It is with (the) greatest sorrow and regret that I must inform the world that yesterday we lost My Sister, the night to my day, the bread to this butter, my singing partner, my road dog, my right-hand man."

And a family member said online: "Missing you so much baby girl. I would give anything on this earth to have you back."

Parker, also known as Nessa Janovich, was originally from Tacoma, Washington state but lived in Indiana.

She shot around 30 titles between 2014 and 2018, according to AVN.

Paying homage, Grooby creator Kristel Penn said: “We hit it off online beforehand and would chat on occasion, so it felt like meeting an old friend when we finally met in person.

"She and Brooke would bounce around the party like little pixies - it always made me smile. She will certainly be missed."

Her death comes just weeks after the porn industry was rocked by Alicia Rio's passing.
