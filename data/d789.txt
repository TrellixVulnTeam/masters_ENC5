DEAR MISS MANNERS: My wife and I had a couple over for dinner — longtime friends of ours. I prepared filet mignon and served one to each person. As always, we enjoyed their company and our shared meal.

The woman of the couple did not completely finish her filet mignon, which I understand. However, after she finished eating, she said “Oh, Fido is going to enjoy this” — Fido being their dog and “this” being the leftover filet mignon.

I am still irritated, for these reasons: 1. By inviting them to dinner, we implicitly agreed to feed them, not their dog. 2. A statement like, “This steak was very good, but I cannot eat it all; is it OK if I take it home for lunch tomorrow?” would have been acceptable. 3. My wife and I have our own dog, who would have enjoyed the leftover steak.
• Miss Manners: Can I dictate the hair color for my wedding party?
• Miss Manners: What if I’m in someone’s house and I badly need a plunger?
• Miss Manners: Can only women get indignant about unwanted touching?
• Miss Manners: The family is in a tizzy about an invitation I never saw
• Miss Manners: If the meal is free, what do you do about the tip? My wife does not condone my reasons for finding our guest’s statement irritating. She believes that once the food is on a guest’s plate, it is the guest’s to do with as he or she wishes.

Who has dibs on leftover steak? If the leftovers are the guest’s, is it appropriate for the guest to state that it will become dog food? Does the concept of a “doggy bag” exist outside of restaurants?

GENTLE READER: Yes, it exists as a euphemism. Apparently, you would feel better knowing that the lady planned to eat it herself, which may well have been the case. That is the understanding at restaurants, where the food has been bought by the customer.

But after the holiday season, where fighting over leftovers seems to have become a major social sport, Miss Manners refuses to continue with issues concerning food left on individual plates. Please consider that having specifically given this food to your guest, you have no further interest in its destination.

DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband and I are moving to a small, charming city very popular with tourists. In the past, we have hosted guests in our small condo there, and we expect to continuing welcoming visitors to our slightly larger home. As we will now be locals, I plan to get involved in organizations and activities.

When we have guests, is it permissible for me to encourage them to do some activities on their own? We would provide them with a car, and spend part of every day with them, but now that we will no longer be visitors ourselves, I’d rather encourage our guests to be more independent. Is there a way to do that without being rude?

GENTLE READER: It may not have occurred to you, but Miss Manners assures you that even the most grateful guests wonder how they can have some time on their own without seeming rude to their hosts.

It is up to you, as hosts, to set the schedule, explaining when you have time to be with them, and asking if they want suggestions about what to do in their free time.
