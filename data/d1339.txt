A man is to stand trial charged with the murder of a mother.

Michael Dorey, 47, is accused of killing Jacqueline Grant at her home in Maryhill, Glasgow on April 6 2021.

Prosecutors allege he repeatedly struck the 54 year-old with a knife or knives on her head and body.

A hearing took place at the High Court in Glasgow, where defence QC Donald Findlay pled not guilty on Dorey's behalf.

Prosecutor Margaret Barron said she was ready for a trial to be set.

The case could last around seven days.
