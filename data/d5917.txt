"JDMBALFG," the post read, likely a reference to the J.D. and M.B.A. degrees he earned along with the phrase "LFG" which stands for "Let’s F------ Go." The post also contained a photo of a graduation banner and a photo of Schlossberg in a library.

Schlossberg, the youngest child and only son of Caroline Kennedy and designer Edwin Schlossberg, enrolled at Harvard in 2017 after earning his undergraduate degree from Yale University.

John F. Kennedy and Caroline Kennedy also graduated from Harvard, along with Schlossberg’s great-grandfather, Joseph Kennedy, Sr.

It is not clear whether Schlossberg intends to pursue a career in politics, but he has in the past he is "inspired by my family's legacy of public service" and that "it’s something that I am very proud of."
