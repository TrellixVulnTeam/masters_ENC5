The honour completes a good year for Hamilton which saw him equal Michael Schumacher’s record seventh Formula One title and being voted Sports Personality of the Year a second time.

There is a damehood for actress Sheila Hancock, who made her name in the West End before becoming a perennial figure on British TV screens.

“I’ve never felt myself this sort of person. It just doesn’t happen to people like me. I feel I may be lowering the tone. I feel slightly miscast, let’s put it that way,” she said.

Hamilton’s knighthood – awarded in the overseas list – may raise eyebrows, both because of his decision to relocate to Monaco in 2010 and also because he credited his success in 2020 to a new determination inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.

In November, Motorsport UK launched a campaign with the All Party Parliamentary Group for Formula One to ensure he was handed a knighthood, with chairman David Richards saying the driver’s tax status had been “totally misunderstood” and he was among the top 5,000 highest taxpayers in the UK.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Boxing Day, he said: “It was a different drive than what I’ve had in me in the past, to get to the end of those races first so that I could utilise that platform (for Black Lives Matter) and shine the light as bright as possible.”

Welsh actor Michael Sheen revealed on Tuesday he handed back his OBE so he could air his views about the monarchy and its role in Wales without being a “hypocrite”.

Many people looking out for the wellbeing of NHS staff during the pandemic received recognition including Greta Westwood, chief executive of nursing charity the Florence Nightingale Foundation, who is given a CBE.

Wadia, who rose to fame in sketch show Goodness Gracious Me, is made an OBE, while Dynevor, who has played Sally Webster on the soap since 1986, becomes an MBE.

She is closely followed by 104-year-old Ruth Saunders, from Newbury in Berkshire, who gets an MBE for walking a marathon to raise money for the Thames Valley Air Ambulance.

Among the more unusual efforts being honoured are those of Veronica Main from Hazlemere in Buckinghamshire, who receives an MBE for services to Straw Hat Plaiting and Endangered Crafts Skills.
