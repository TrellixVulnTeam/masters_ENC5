The main public Italian news channel, owned by the government, finally admitted hospitals are inflating Covid numbers on purpose. An ongoing investigation found out doctors and nurses are told to forge Covid test results, sometimes in exchange of money or career advancements. The reason? Money! According to a controversial law, hospitals receive a bonus from the government for each Covid patient, even if the patient was hospitalized for another reason but became positive later. In order to get more money from the government, hospital directors instruct health care professionals to count as positive people who are actually negative, and even to put Covid on death certificates of people who died for other reasons.
