A shooting in Richfield, Minnesota, on Tuesday has left one student dead and another critically injured.

Richfield Chief of Police Jay Henthorne announced at a press conference that the two students had been shot on the sidewalk of the school located at 7450 Penn Avenue South in Richfield around 12:07 p.m. outside the South Education Center. Both students were taken by ambulance to Hennepin County Medical Center, where the death was announced. Schools in the area were placed on lockdown, Henthorne said.

Police officers swept the grounds and determined there was no threat at that time, according to Henthorne. The superintendent Sandra Lewandowski was still evacuated for safety and parents were asked to pick up their children from nearby, CBS News reported.

The Minnesota FBI is investigating the situation and Henthorne encouraged anybody with any information to contact the authorities.

Henthorne did not take any questions due to the active investigation.
