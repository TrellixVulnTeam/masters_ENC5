“What I’m gonna say is, these people — these Democrats who tried to use this as some type of political issue to try to smear me, as if I had something to do with it? We’re not playing their game.

“But I’m not gonna have people try to smear me that belong to a political party that has elevated anti-Semites to the Halls of Congress like Ilhan Omar; that have played footsie with the BDS Movement; that even have people in their party that have even cavorted with [Nation of Islam leader Louis] Farrakhan.

“No. We’re gonna take our record in Florida and what we’ve done — signed the strongest anti-Semitism bill in the country; we’ve stood and stared down companies that were indulged in BDS, like Airbnb, and we’ve won.”
