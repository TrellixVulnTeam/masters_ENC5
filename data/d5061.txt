ðŸ†˜URGENT! New oil spill in Ecuador on the banks of the Coca river, in what appears to be a new rupture of the @OCPEcuador pipeline. Over 27,000 Kichwa living downriver still suffereing impacts of massive April 2020 oil spill. Government & courts did nothing. This is the result. pic.twitter.com/eTgwtO4kvv
