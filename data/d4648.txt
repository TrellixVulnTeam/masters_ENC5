THE January transfer window is now SLAMMED shut as we look ahead to what should be an eventful pre-World Cup summer.

On a dramatic deadline day, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang completed his FREE transfer to Barcelona.

The Gabon striker is taking a significant pay cut to sign for Barca.

Elsewhere, Dele Alli joined Frank Lampard in signing for Everton also on a free transfer.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy negotiated a deal which will see his club secure £10m if Alli makes over 20 appearances on Merseyside.

But Everton will have to pay four times that amount if Alli goes on to be a regular for the club over the remainder of his contract.
