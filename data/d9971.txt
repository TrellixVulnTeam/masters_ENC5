FOR MANY beauty fans, contouring is an essential part of their makeup routine.

But for those wishing to save some time, there's a trick that will get you the perfect face contour using fake tan.

A beauty guru named Em shared her hack to achieving a contoured look with self-tanner in a TikTok that's been viewed a staggering 3.5 million times.

She started off by spraying a few pumps of a foam tanner on a fluffy makeup brush, specifically one for contouring.

She then swiped the product high along her cheekbones and near her hairline and used a round brush to blend it in.

Em similarly applied more self-tanner to her jawline using the fluffy brush then blended with the same round brush as before.

Next, the makeup guru contoured her nose with a small eyeshadow brush dipped in the tanner.

And lastly, she applied the color to the creases of her eyes and above the cupid's bow of her lips, and she was left with a perfectly contoured look.

In the comment section, she clarified that you should let the tan develop overnight then wash it off in the morning.

In a subsequent video, Em revealed what the tan looked like in the morning and after her skincare routine.

Her perfectly applied self-tanner allowed her to skip the contouring step in her makeup routine altogether.

Several people were impressed with the results, like one user who wrote: "I was so worried it was going to be too harsh but this tanner doesnâ€™t look bad at all."

Someone added: "You look like you spent the whole day at the beach wow it looks amazing I'm going to try it," while another commented: "Yup, gonna have to try this. You just confirmed that for me."
