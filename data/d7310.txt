Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., on Tuesday said the current version of the Build Back Better bill is "dead," while indicating he was open to further talks with the White House.

Manchin has long objected to the key social and climate spending legislation which is central to President Joe Biden's agenda and dismissed the possibility of the bill passing in its current form when asked about the status of the legislation on Tuesday.
