Anthea Turner enjoyed a romantic evening out with her fiancé Mark Armstrong at the new Bob Marley One Love Experience exhibition at The Saatchi Gallery.

The presenter, 61, was on top form as she sipped a cocktail and chatted with other guests.

The former Blue Peter star wore a light brown dress and white boots for the first glimpse at the exhibition celebrating the life of the reggae singer.

The Bob Marley experience will showcase his unseen photographs and memorabilia and take people through his lifestyle, influences and formidable legacy. The exhibition will be on for ten weeks and carefully pays tribute to the artiste who died aged just 36. His record sales have topped an estimated 75 million with the song One Love his biggest hit.

Curated by the Marley family alongside Jonathan Shank of Terrapin Station, One Love has a variety of insights into the musician’s life.

At every turn through the corridors of the Saatchi, visitors are encouraged to put themselves into the show and leave their mark on it for whoever arrives next to enjoy.

The usual fare – gold discs, hand-written lyrics, stage-worn outfits – are also on display, but the experience’s most impressive components are its deeply interactive aspects and the original art created exclusively for this run.

Across the experience, visitors travel through natural landscapes, dance floors, games rooms and concert venues.

First, you arrive at the One Love Forest, a room with synthetic grass and sounds of tweeting wildlife piped through speakers, soundtracked by Marley’s greatest hits while smoke billows from behind the shrubbery.

Elsewhere, you’re handed a pair of headphones just outside the ‘Soul Shakedown Studio’ and beckoned onto a dance floor to enjoy one of Marley’s revolutionary live shows while a giant disco ball sparkles overhead.
