In November 2020, 19-year-old Adrienne Sophia was ejected from her car and killed when by a drunk driver in Houston. Heriberto Fuerte-Padilla, an illegal alien, was driving drunk when he killed Adrienne Sophia at 1:30 PM in the afternoon.

Sgt. Aric Albers with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office, who issued an update to reporters from the scene of the crash, said that’s when Exum was hit by a driver in a Dodge pickup truck. That driver was later identified as Heriberto Fuerte-Padilla.

“[She was] ejected out of the vehicle into the roadway,” he said. “Her head struck the roadway and she sustained a significant injury where she ended up dying on the scene.”

Albers said the man who was with Exum was not injured in the crash. The two men involved in the altercation were detained.

Meanwhile, Gonzalez said Padilla tried to get away after the crash before deputies arrived. Albers said he was found a few hundred yards away and was detained by an off-duty officer in the area.

Padilla was found to be intoxicated, according to Albers, and has since been charged with DWI and failure to render aid.
