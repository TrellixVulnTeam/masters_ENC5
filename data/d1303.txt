For weeks Mr Sunak has been urged to make use of Brexit freedoms to cut VAT from energy bills to save hard-working Britons money.

Coming under fresh pressure in the Commons this morning, the minister hinted he was preparing to take action to reduce the burden on families grappling with the current cost of living crisis.

The Chancellor said he would "continue to look at all the policies we have in place" as he was quizzed by MPs.

Responding to a question by former Conservative work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb, Mr Sunak said: "I am of course aware of people's anxieties about what is coming.

"He can rest assured that we will continue to look at all the policies we have in place to make sure that we are supporting people in the best way possible through the months ahead."

Mr Crabb had urged the Government to "do something" about spiralling energy costs.

He said: "Can I say respectfully to the Chancellor that we are going to have to do something around energy costs.

"On Friday I met with a couple in my constituency who showed me their fixed tariff agreement for energy coming to an end and a new one that is coming on stream is more than double.

"They are going to really struggle this year paying their energy costs."
