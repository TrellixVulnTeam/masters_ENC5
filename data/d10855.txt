The thing is, it’s not easy shopping for seductive date night underwear or finding pulling pants when your curves are above average. Plus size lingerie used to mean beige, black or grey undergarments with about as much sex appeal as your grandad’s false teeth.

Thankfully retailers have cottoned onto the power of the plus size pound and now there’s more choice in inclusive sizes than ever, backed by the celebrity spotlight of A-listers like Lizzo, Tess Holliday and Ashley Graham.

While plus size clothing is widely regarded as size 16 and above, plus size lingerie is for those who wear a bra cup D or bigger. Online lingerie brand Figleaves says: "Anything 40 (for the underband) and above we would see as plus size; this is equivalent to an 18/20 dress size."

Your bra size can change all the time, from exercise and hormones to pregnancy and lockdown weight, so it’s important to make sure you’re wearing a bra that supports in all the right places.

Even if you think you know your size, it’s worth double checking regularly. Research by lingerie brand Nudea in 2019 found that just 10 per cent of its 600 respondants were wearing the right bra for them. It also found nearly half of women haven’t had their chest measures for more than five years.
