A BRAVE bottlenose dolphin has a whale of a time despite looking like small fry as itâ€™s dwarfed by a massive ship.

The acrobatic creature leapt 8ft into the air before splashing down just feet from the 945ft-long gas tanker.

He was on an outing in Weymouth Bay, Dorset, on his 64th birthday.

The dolphin certainly treated him to a flipping great show.
