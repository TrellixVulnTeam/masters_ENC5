— Tories to review O’Toole’s leadership tomorrow: Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole will face a leadership review tomorrow after 35 MPs signed a letter calling for a review vote. Late last night, he took to social media to say he would welcome the vote. “I’m not going anywhere and I’m not turning back,” he wrote. “It’s time for a reckoning. To settle this in caucus. Right here. Right now. Once and for all.” One MP told Global news the review goes beyond just O’Toole’s leadership but rather is about a “fracture in the party.”

— ‘Conservatism is organic’: O’Toole said on Twitter: “There are two roads open to the Conservative Party of Canada. One is the road of Randy Hillier and Derek Sloan. It is angry, negative, and extreme. It is a dead-end … The other road is to better reflect the Canada of 2022. To recognize that conservatism is organic not static and that a winning message is one of inclusion, optimism, ideas and hope.”

— Kady O’Malley writes in iPolitics AM that, as “the open-ended anti-vaccine mandate protest lining the streets surrounding Parliament Hill heads into a fourth day, a new political psychodrama has started to play out within the walls of the precinct itself, courtesy of what the Globe and Mail describes as a ‘caucus revolt’ targeting embattled Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole, who could see his job performance put to a secret ballot vote as early as Wednesday.

— Here to stay: The remaining trucker protestors in Ottawa say they will stay until all COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. Crowds have “thinned out considerably” on Parliament Hill, according to the Canadian Press. But the Ottawa Gatineau Hotel Association says some protesters have been extending stays or looking to rebook for next weekend. Meanwhile, Ottawa police are setting up a hate crime hotline following reports of assaults and threats.

Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said yesterday there is “no sign whatsoever” that the vaccine mandate has affected cross-border truck volume — comments that his Conservative critic dismissed as misleading. Trudeau said yesterday he “won’t give in” to the protesters.

— Alberta border crossing still blocked: A truck blockade at a U.S. border crossing in southern Alberta is entering its fourth day. The RCMP says it is ready to tow vehicles and make arrests.

— Hopes for diplomacy: Russia has responded to the U.S.’s proposal on Ukraine in a written “follow-up” letter. It came on the eve of a call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. The written response followed high tensions yesterday at the UN Security Council.

— The Downing Street report is in: The U.K. government received the final report following an internal investigation into Downing Street parties by the civil servant Sue Gray. The government initially only published part of the report, but even the most conservative tabloids have called on No. 10 to publish the full report. The Sue Gray report, which said the government’s behaviour was “difficult to justify,” is separate from a police investigation into the parties, which may have broken the law during the first COVID lockdown.
