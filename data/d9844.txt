Last night it was announced that Whoopi Goldberg was suspended from The View by ABC after her controversial Holocaust comments:

THE HILL – Whoopi Goldberg has been suspended from ABC’s “The View” for two weeks following her comments on the Holocaust.

“Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments. While Whoopi has apologized, I’ve asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact of her comments,” Kim Godwin, president of ABC News, said in a statement.

“The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family and communities,” she added.

The announcement followed one day after Goldberg told her co-hosts on the show that the Holocaust was “not about race” as they were discussing the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel “Maus” and the decision to remove it by a Tennessee school board from a curriculum for eighth grade language arts.

“If you’re going to do this, then let’s be truthful about it,” Goldberg said on Monday during the discussion. “Because the Holocaust isn’t about race. No, it’s not about race.”
