Update (1341ET): To the surprise of absolutely no-one, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is pissed that Build Back Better is effectively 'dead,' suggesting that Manchin is siding with "corporate America."

Having experienced the usual BTFD bounce this morning after opening weakness, US equity markets are sliding after reports that Senator Joe Manchin has unequivocably stated that President Biden's Build Back Better bill is "dead."

We are not exactly sure what the market was expecting but this was enough to send stocks lower...

Manchin's comments come one day after CNBC megaphoned the new narrative about the moderate Democrat, that "Companies, executives donated nearly $300,000 to Manchin’s campaign after he rejected Biden’s Build Back Better bill."

Manchin’s campaign also received individual contributions from leading executives after he effectively blocked Build Back Better... ...A month before his contributions to Manchin’s operations, Langone praised the senator live on CNBC. Langone also said he intended to host a massive fundraising event for the conservative Democrat. -CNBC

None of this should come as a surprise, of course. Three weeks ago, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) admitted that his party's bid to forward their agenda - between Build Back Better and trying to eliminate the filibuster, would be an 'uphill battle.'

"I don’t want to delude your listeners: This is an uphill fight, because Manchin and Sinema both do not believe in changing the rules," Schumer admitted during a Center for American Progress event in January, according to Politico.

And of course, this is setting up to be a bloodbath for Democrats in the upcoming midterms.
