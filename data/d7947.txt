“That round two is basically going south, so we’re not looking for anything significant from it. However, we are going to get some lake effect snow. It’s still uncertain whether it sets up on any one location or whether it’s all over the place, so 2 to 5 inches is possible, but there’s a lot of variation to be expected,” Sullivan said. “Even in those areas where we expect lake effect snow, it doesn’t mean they’re all necessarily going to get it. Some could get a dusting while others get 5 inches.”
