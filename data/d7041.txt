“If you’ve got a race to the bottom, you’ve got to raise the bottom, and then maybe the race will slow down a little bit,” said Jeff Hermanson, an official at the Solidarity Center, an arm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

When workers at the General Motors plant voted on whether to throw out their contract in April, the government suspended the election after inspectors found destroyed ballots inside the offices of the existing union, part of the Confederation of Mexican Workers.

The irregularities prompted the Biden administration to, for the first time, take advantage of a channel for labor disputes established in the new trade accord, and formally ask Mexico to review the case. The Mexican government called for a new vote. In August, workers elected to throw out their contract — and they are now preparing to vote for the union that will negotiate a new one.

Mr. Ramírez said he planned to cast his ballot for the independent union.

Last week, he asked his boss for two days off because his wife had spent days alone with their baby at the hospital. The request was rejected.

“You are failing as a husband,” he said about himself, “because you can’t give her the reinforcement she needs.”

He doesn’t know how much his life will change if the independent union wins. But for once, he hopes, the workers will have a say.
