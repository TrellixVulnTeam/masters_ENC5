The renowned Australian music manager Glenn Wheatley has died at the age of 74, according to media reports.

Wheatley, who managed high-profile entertainers including John Farnham and Delta Goodrem, reportedly died after being hospitalised with Covid-19.

The Queensland-born Wheatley was bassist for the Masters Apprentices in the 1960s, playing on the hits Turn Up Your Radio and Because I Love You. He established the Wheatley Organisation in 1975 and became manager of Little River Band.

Wheatley mortgaged his house to bankroll Farnham’s 1986 comeback album Whispering Jack, which went on to become one of Australia’s biggest-selling Australian albums.

The LP revitalised Farnham’s career and the last song to be added to it – You’re the Voice – became an Australian pop anthem.

After mixing the initial version of the song, Wheatley was left flat so Farnham jumped back in the recording booth. “He sang the livin’ bejesus out of it,” Wheatley said in an oral history published in 2014.

Wheatley helped Goodrem launch her 2003 debut Innocent Eyes.



He also spent about 10 months in jail in 2007 after pleading guilty to charges of tax evasion.
