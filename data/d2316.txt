Cancer and health charities have welcomed a ban on smoking in cars with children in Northern Ireland.

The rule can be enforced from Tuesday with fines possible up to Â£2,500.

It brings Northern Ireland into line with other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster spoke to members of the public to get their views on the ban.
