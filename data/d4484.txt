A 25-year-old man taken into custody last winter asked New York City jail officials if he could see a dentist for cavities. But his consistent requests for care went unanswered, according to court records and lawyers for the man, even as it became difficult for him to eat and sleep because of the pain.

His mouth became infected, leaking blood and pus. He was in agony by the time he finally saw a dentist last month, nearly a year since he first requested medical treatment. He was told he would need extensive surgery.

His story is emblematic of the basic medical neglect in New York City’s jails, where data from the city itself shows that thousands of incarcerated people miss appointments each month. Lawyers for the detainees say that the lack of timely care, even for simple ailments, leads to extreme sickness and pain: surgery dates delayed for months, stab and burn victims whose wounds are left untreated and bug bites that swell up to take over prisoners’ entire legs.

Last year, 16 people died in New York City jails, the highest number in years. The chief medical officer of Correctional Health Services, Dr. Ross MacDonald, attributed the deaths to a collapse in basic jail operations, including the delays in medical care, which he said were caused by the unavailability of correction officers — hundreds of whom do not show up for work each day.
