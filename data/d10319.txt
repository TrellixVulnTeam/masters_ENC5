The government watchdog group Judicial Watch has just sued the CIA.

Judicial Watch previously filed a FOIA request to obtain communication records between CIA Director Gina Haspel and Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley.

According to Judicial Watch Gen. Milley and Haspel reportedly had conversations with one another in a plot to target Trump after the 2020 election.

Haspel reportedly went on record saying “we are on the way to a right-wing coup” under Trump’s leadership.

Well, the Pentagon completely ignored Judicial Watch’s FOIA request so now the watchdog group is suing the CIA for refusing to abide by FOIA.

CNS News had more on the story:

The government watchdog group Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for communications between then-CIA Director Gina Haspel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley in 2020-21, which reportedly involved the targeting of President Donald Trump. As reported in Newsweek, in the days after the 2020 presidential election, Haspel apparently told Milley, “We are on the way to a right-wing coup.” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton in a statement said, “It ought to be disturbing to all Americans that the head of the CIA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs were reportedly conspiring against the President of the United States.” “Our new lawsuit will hopefully ferret out the truth about any plots to undermine President Trump by the military and CIA,” added Fitton. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, notes that Judicial Watch filed a standard FOIA request with the CIA in September 2021, but this request was ignored.

I think we all know why the CIA refused to release the communication records of Haspel and Milley…
