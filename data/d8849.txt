CNN boss Jeff Zucker was forced to resign from the network on Wednesday after he was caught having an affair with another CNN staffer, according to a New York Times report.

Zucker, who was known for relentlessly pursuing anti-Trump propaganda at the far-left cable network for nine years, confessed to colleagues in a memo that the inappropriate relationship came up during the CNN’s probe into Chris Cuomo’s sexual harassment.

“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker wrote.

“I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years,” Zucker wrote. “I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong.”
