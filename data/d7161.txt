GOOD Morning Britain's Adil Ray and Susanna Reid had their say on Simon Cowell's accident after he was rushed to hospital following another e-bike smash.

The Sun exclusively revealed that Simon, 62, was "lucky to be alive" following his latest crash which left the Britain's Got Talent judge with suspected concussion and a broken arm.

Speaking on the ITV show on Wednesday Adil, 47, said: "Simon Cowell needs to stay off bikes, doesn't he?"

But Susanna, 51, replied: "But isn't the advice when you fall off your bike to get back on the bike?"

Charlotte Hawkins added: "Don't forget the helmet, he needs to wear a helmet."

Adil agreed saying: "Yeah, not wearing a helmet. Kids, if you're watching, if you're riding bikes, wear a helmet, don't do what Simon Cowell did."

He added: "But get well soon, Mr. Cowell."

Simon's latest crash — near his home in West London — comes 18 months after he broke his back on an e-bike in Los Angeles.

Last night a source said: “Simon is lucky to be alive.

“He was pedalling along, with his electric motor on, when the wheels suddenly went from under him after hitting a wet patch.

"He slipped and went flying over the handlebars into the middle of the road.

“Stupidly, Simon wasn’t wearing a helmet, and blood was pouring from his face — he looked like something from Phantom of the Opera.

“Three kindly passers-by jumped into action, and stopped the traffic so he wouldn’t be run over.

“After being ambulanced to hospital and given an X-ray, Simon was eventually released that evening — his arm in a yellow cast all the way up to the shoulder — and told to rest.

“Despite this being his second great escape, Simon insists he’s not ditching the bike — but he will start wearing a helmet.”
