A WEALTHY socialite who allegedly drunkenly hit and killed a 9-year-old boy and his 11-year-old brother was charged with murder after she drove her Mercedes-Benz for a quarter-mile before stopping.

Former Westlake Magazine publisher Rebecca Grossman was charged with murder and vehicular manslaughter after she reportedly slammed her Mercedes-Benz into Jacob Iskander, 9, and his 11-year-old brother Mark in Los Angeles.

Police say Grossman, reportedly driving while under the influence of alcohol, was allegedly speeding down a Westlake Village street in Los Angeles on September 29 when she plowed into the Iskander brothers as they crossed the street.

The brothers were walking with their parents, younger sibling, and three other family members at the time of the crash. Police say their mom tried to pull the two boys back as well as the toddler in a stroller, but was too late to save her sons.

Mark died upon impact, police say, while his brother was rushed to a local hospital but could not be saved.

At the time of the crash, police said speeding and alcohol were both factors in the fatal event.

Authorities also said Grossman drove for about a quarter of a mile before she pulled over.

Grossman, who is married to prominent plastic surgeon Peter Grossman, was charged with felony counts on Wednesday.

She was charged with two counts of murder, and two counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.

The socialite was also charged with a count of hit-and-run driving resulting in death and was waiting to be arraigned on Wednesday.
