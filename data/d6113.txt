The Alameda County District Attorney’s Office charged an Oakland woman last week with multiple felonies in connection with a trio of drive-by shootings late last year targeting a Berkeley woman and her 1-year-old child, authorities said.

According to charging documents and police statements, Berkeley police responded to reports of the shootings on Nov. 27, Dec. 1 and Dec. 18, 2021 that damaged the Berkeley woman’s home and vehicle in the 2800 block of Acton Street. Both the woman and her child were home during each shooting.

Investigators were able to identify a suspect, a 20-year-old Oakland woman, and obtain recordings of her conversations with an associate in custody at Santa Rita Jail for murder, a Berkeley police officer said.

In those conversations, each of which happened the morning after, the suspect “discussed getting revenge on the victim, checking for cameras and wanting to see the victim’s baby ‘stop breathing,’ ” the officer said.

After investigators found that the woman’s cell phone records placed her phone at each shooting’s scene, detectives obtained search warrants for her home and a warrant for her arrest. She was arrested last Thursday at an East Oakland apartment with help from the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force, and a firearm was recovered at her home, police said.

According to police, the woman denied involvement after being read her rights, but later admitted to a role, adding that a personal dispute motivated her to seek to harm the woman and her child.

Last Friday, the district attorney’s office charged the woman, who had prior arrests for robbery and felony assault with a deadly weapon, with stalking, discharging a firearm with gross negligence, vandalism, and multiple counts of shooting at an inhabited dwelling and assault with a deadly weapon or firearm, as well as several criminal enhancements.
