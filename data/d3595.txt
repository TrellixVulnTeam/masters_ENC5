BORIS Johnson used parliamentary privilege to expose how Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile.

In the House of Commons on Monday, Prime Minister Johnson claimed Sir Keir “used his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”.

The extraordinary claims were exposed by Politicalite in 2020 – and now Sir Keir has hit back branding the claim a “ridiculous slur peddled by right-wing trolls”

Sir Keir told Sky News: “It is a ridiculous slur peddled by right-wing trolls… this is where I saw the faces of the Conservative MPs, the disgust on their faces that their Prime Minister was debasing himself by sinking so low in the Chamber was clear.

“They knew that he was going so low with that slur, with that lie – he had been advised not to do it because it’s obviously not true, but he does it because he doesn’t understand what honesty and integrity means.”

Sky News’ Kay Burley questioned Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab refused to repeat the allegation thrown at the Labour leader by Mr Johnson.

Mr Raab, the Justice Secretary, said he was “certainly not repeating it” during a broadcast interview, without the protection of parliamentary privilege.

LABOUR’s new boss Sir Keir Starmer helped renowned paedophile Jimmy Saville evade justice in 2009, three years before he died, it has been claimed.

In 2009, former Top of the Pops host and Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Saville, who abused victims in NHS hospitals, including children as young as five, was arrested and interviewed under caution by Sussex Police.

During the interview, it was alleged that Saville had abused three girls under the age of 16.

It’s claimed that the Police force referred four cases to Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service – headed by Kier Starmer.
