Oti Mabuse insists it is "not for her to say" if she will be returning to Strictly Come Dancing.

The professional dancer - who won the show two years in a row previously - has been subjected to rumours that she may not return to the BBC One show later this year for its new series, after signing up as a judge on rival channel ITV's Dancing On Ice.

However, she has insisted "no one is bigger than that show" and that it is "not for her to say" if she will be back on the show as a pro dancer when it returns in the autumn for another series.

Speaking to the Metro.co.uk, she said: "Everybody keeps asking me. It’s not for me to say. Strictly is such a big machine and no one is bigger than that show. To touch anything around Strictly is such an honour and it will always be who I am.

"For everyone who’s on it and part of it on and off screen, we all truly love it."

Oti currently judges on Dancing On Ice and is embarking on a tour, but despite her busy schedule, she doesn't like to say no to things.

"Everything is on a schedule and somehow works out. I try not to say no to a lot of things. It doesn’t feel like work unless I’m really tired. I get to dance on Strictly and meet incredible celebrities," she added.

"I get to watch celebrities figure skating every Sunday and empathise with what they’re going through. And my dance school is something I’ve always wanted."

A few weeks ago, Oti broke her silence on rumours she was leaving Strictly.

"There will be an announcement that will be made later, but for me, as a person in entertainment, I really want to learn and grow and I want a long career, especially in this country," she told The Mirror and other press.

"I moved all the way from Africa so I have to make something of myself, so I'm really trying to learn and do as much as I can for as long as I can while I can."
