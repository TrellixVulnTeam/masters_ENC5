Feb. 1 (UPI) -- More than 400 Native American tribes reached a $590-million settlement Tuesday with Johnson & Johnson and three other drug distributors, according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Cleveland.

Johnson & Johnson said it will pay $150 million over a two-year time frame, while McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen will collectively cover an additional almost $440 million over seven years, reports the New York Times.
