Post Malone was recently featured on the cover of Billboard’s “2022 Power List” issue. He doesn’t look “powerful” at all.

Katy Perry is another artist whose career has been in full-on humiliation mode. In the past couple of years, I’ve posted several pictures of her in ridiculous costumes and embarrassing situations. The trend is still strong today.

Speaking of mental illness, Demi Lovato is clearly not OK. In fact, she represents one of the most blatant examples of MK programming in the entertainment industry.

Britney Spears is the most obvious case of Monarch programming in the entertainment industry. Like Demi Lovato, Britney was recruited at a young age and was owned by Disney for several years. While recent events lead many to believe that Britney was finally free from her family’s conservatorship, she is not free at all. Her Instagram account could not be more obvious.

As usual, the one-eye sign was all over the place in the past weeks. They’re a constant reminder that the world’s biggest stars must show their complete submission to the elite – in the most public way possible – in order to keep going.

Mariah Carey has been an industry slave ever since she was involved with Tommy Mottola in the 1990s. Over 30 years later, at age 52, she still needs to show submission to the industry.

The gender-blurring agenda is one of the elite’s obsessions and it keeps manifesting itself in pop culture in the most absurd ways possible. Despite the fact that the great majority of people absolutely hate this agenda, the world’s biggest companies and organizations keep gaslighting the world with it.
