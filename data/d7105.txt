The trip is available between May and September, 2022, and travellers can book with a deposit of £125pp.

From £499pp, all packages include return flights to Belfast, airport taxes and hand luggage allowance, coach transport between sites, and a 3-night stay at the 3-star Ramada by Wyndham in Belfast with breakfast and dinner.

Departures are available from airports across the UK, including London Stansted, Gatwick and Luton, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle.

It is worth noting that a single supplement charge of £120 will be applied to solo travellers.

Visitors will be able to take a closer look at the costumes, sets, props and visual effects during their self-guided tour of the Game of Thrones Studio.

During the coach tour, you'll drive along the Antrim Coast while seeing some of the famous locations such as Castle Black and The Wall, or the harbour steps where The Waif attacked Arya Stark.

The coach tour will make one last stop at the Giant’s Causeway.

While the UNESCO World Heritage site didn't appear in Game of Thrones, it is a must-see.

Travellers will also have the chance to visit Belfast as there will be free time to go shopping, visit a museum or just have a nice stroll around the city.
