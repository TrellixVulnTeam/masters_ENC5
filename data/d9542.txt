Police are investigating a massive brawl that broke out inside a Bensalem, Pennsylvania, buffet Friday evening.

Customer Alexis Rios said the fight was started by a steak-related misunderstanding, according to WPVI-TV. The customer in front of Rios was reportedly upset because his well-done steak was taking longer to prepare than Rios’ rare steak.

People had a hard time understanding each other due to COVID-19 face masks, which escalated tensions, Rios told WPVI-TV. “With COVID right now, masks and everything, nobody can hear nobody sometimes.”

A video shared by Levittown Now showed a crowd of several dozen people forming to watch the beginning of the altercation, with many people shouting over each other. After about a minute, someone can be seen raising a chair above their head, followed immediately by numerous people throwing chairs.
