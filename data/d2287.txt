A 477-mile-long lightning bolt crossed three southern US states, and is now verified by the World Meteorolgical Organization to be world-record breaking.

The previous record was 440.6 miles (709 km) and recorded in Brazil in 2018. Scientists say the area in which these states are located are especially prone to lightning.
