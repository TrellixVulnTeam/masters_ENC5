Those who think the Washington Football Team’s next name is the “Washington Commanders” just got another huge clue in their favor.

An NBC4 helicopter spotted signage featuring the name “Commanders” at FedEx Field on Tuesday evening — roughly 12 hours before the team was set to unveil the name on NBC’s “Today” show.

Speculation over the name Commanders has grown in recent weeks, with internet sleuths uncovering all sorts of hints that indicated the team’s rebrand was trending that way.

One person discovered the registrant for “Commanders.com” was a company that frequently deals with the NFL, while others noticed unblurred papers featuring the name “Commanders” sitting on Jason Wright’s lap during a television episode of “Washington Football Today.”

The long-awaited announcement comes a year-and-a-half after the franchise said it would no longer go by the moniker Redskins. The former moniker, long deemed offensive by critics, was retired following pressure from fans and corporate sponsors in July 2020.
