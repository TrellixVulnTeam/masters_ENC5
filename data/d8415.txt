Goldberg said Nazis' murder of six million Jews was 'not about race'

ABC News suspended comedian Whoopi Goldberg from cohosting The View for saying the Holocaust "isn't about race."

Goldberg said in a Monday episode of the show that the Nazis' murder of six million Jews was "not about race" but rather "man's inhumanity to man."

The Holocaust was "white people doing it to white people, so y'all going to fight amongst yourselves," Goldberg said.

The Nazis committed mass genocide out of a belief that Jews were an inferior race.

While Goldberg apologized for her remarks that same day on The Late Show and the next day on The View, ABC president Kim Godwin said the apologies weren't enough.

"Effective immediately, I am suspending Whoopi Goldberg for two weeks for her wrong and hurtful comments," Godwin said in a statement.

Goldberg made the remarks during a discussion on the Holocaust-themed graphic novel Maus, which she and other members of the media falsely said is being banned from schools.

Goldberg's comments came amid an uptick in anti-Semitism. An Islamic terrorist last month took four hostages at a Texas synagogue. Attacks on Jewish students have in recent years skyrocketed at U.S. universities. And Amazon sells and streams more than 30 Nazi propaganda films, the Washington Free Beacon has reported.
