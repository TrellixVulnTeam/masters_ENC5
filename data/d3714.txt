Sara is joined by National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera to discuss the video of border agents expressing their deep frustration over current immigration policy with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Raul Ortiz, head of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.

Cabrera tells us more about what happened in that meeting, what the “root cause” really is for the the human tide coming across our southern border and what can be done to fix the problem. Sara also applauds the Canadian trucker convoy rolling to Ottawa to protest vaccine mandates and explains why their message is so critical.
