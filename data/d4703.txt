Detectives questioning Mason Greenwood, the Manchester United footballer on suspicion of rape and assault, have further arrested him on suspicion of sexual assault and threats to kill.

Police were granted an extension to continue questioning the 20-year-old striker, who was arrested at his Cheshire home at the weekend.

Mr Greenwood was detained after a series of social media images were posted online by a woman who claimed she had been assaulted.

Manchester United later issued a statement saying the player would not be training or playing with the squad until further notice.

Greater Manchester Police have not officially named the man in custody.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: "Detectives have been granted further additional time to speak to a man in his 20s who was arrested on suspicion of rape and assault of a woman.

"The suspect was detained in custody on Sunday (30 January) afternoon after we became aware of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence.

"He continues to be questioned after magistrates authorised an extension until Wednesday 2 February.

"Following enquiries so far, he has since been further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and threats to kill. Enquiries are ongoing and the victim continues to be offered specialist support.

"We remind people to avoid any commentary or sharing of images that could compromise the victim's right to lifelong anonymity, or risk prejudicing a live investigation with active proceedings."
