Whoopi Goldberg has officially received her punishment for her insensitive Holocaust comments: two weeks suspension. Her consequences have sparked intense debate over whether suspension is a harsh enough response from the network, as well as anger as to why it took over two days for ABC to make the decision at all.

Goldberg said the Holocaust was “not about race” but rather “man’s inhumanity to man.” She also said it was “two white groups of people.”

The New York Post reports ABC insiders insist her apology came too late and have demanded she be fired. The outlet added that Goldberg’s co-hosts Sunny Hostin, Joy Behar and Ana Navarro are furious that she was suspended because she is a “lifelong ally to the Jewish community” and it was “an incredibly unfortunate incident.”

However, Holocaust survivors and their families have come out in droves to confront Goldberg with her rhetoric. Sami Steigmann was sent to a labor camp with his parents in 1940 and was subjected to inhumane “medical experiments” for the Nazis.

Steigmann told Fox News “Someone of her stature has to be extremely careful to use the proper language and not to perpetuate false narratives.” He added “I’m extremely disappointed in her for making such as stupid comment. I don’t know the motive for why she said it, but the damage has been done.”
