New Year’s Eve is is set to bring 2020 to a “bitterly cold” end, with warnings over snow and ice in place across the UK.

Temperatures were forecast to plunge below -5C in the glens of Scotland overnight on Wednesday while snow is forecast to hit parts of northern and western England throughout Thursday, according to the Met Office.

Forecasters warned these areas should also expect showers of rain and sleet, which could lead to an even “further covering of snow in some places”.

A snow and ice weather warning is still in place for large parts of northern England, as well as areas in Scotland, until 2pm on Thursday. A separate snow and ice warning for northern Scotland and Northern Ireland will expire at 11am.

There is also an ice warning covering the southern tip of England, which remains valid until 11am, with experts predicting some cloud, rain and possible sleet in the far south.

“It does lead into a very cold start to the last day of the year tomorrow," she said, adding: “New Year’s Eve will bear with it again the risk of rain, sleet and snow, another feature sliding down the country from northern Scotland.”

“Particularly inland and over the hills we will see some snow.”

Ms Nasir added that many would see “some brighter weather” during the day, with “a keen breeze keeping things very cold indeed, and again the risk of ice as we head into New Year’s Day”.

Temperatures across the UK are forecast to be between 2C and 6C during the day, with some central and southern regions expected to see the most sunlight.

While Mr Deakin projected temperatures would remain fairly low in January, he also said the New Year would be “a little drier than the last part of December”.

However, “sleet, rain and some snow” will still be part of many’s daily forecast moving into next month, he added.
