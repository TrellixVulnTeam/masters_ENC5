If you are around my age or older, you likely remember The Garbage Pail Kids, essentially a disgusting version of the Cabbage Patch Kids, sold by the Topps company. I distinctly remember how unsettling these images were to my developing mind in the late 80s, as I saw them via older siblings and their friends. It will likely not come as a shock to any of you that these demented characters came from the mind of a jew, Art Spiegelman.

There was actually a pushback at the time the cards came out, as the culture had not yet degenerated as far as it would in coming decades.

They even came out with some horrific looking movies to cash in on the popular cards.

Garbage Pail Kids creator Art Spiegelman is also the authot of the book Maus, a graphic novel about the fictional Holocaust, which was recently banned by a Tennessee school for being too lewd. This, of course, caused international outrage and the book is seeing a huge rise in sales. It turns out that Maus would likely not have even been created if it were not for the success of the Garbage Pail Kids, which gave Spiegelman the money needed to create his graphic novel about evil Nazi cats.

And this isn’t something Spiegelman came up with long before he decided to peer into the darkest depths of the human soul with his serious work — he created the Garbage Pail Kids right in the middle of working on Maus, which took him 13 years. In fact, he has called The Topps Company “my Medici” because, by paying him to design stupid trading cards, they ended up bankrolling his groundbreaking narrative work (he couldn’t just go up to his landlord and hand him some Holocaust pages in lieu of rent).

How very jewish this all is. Art Spiegelman degenerated the minds of innocent children and then indoctrinated them with lies about the Holocaust. Subversive jewishness must be kept away from children.
