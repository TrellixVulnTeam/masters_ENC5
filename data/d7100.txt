Home is where the heart is

Rio Ferdinand is the latest ex-Man Utd defender to weigh in on the Donny van de Beek situation.

And the former England international gave an interesting insight into what drove the player’s decision to head to Everton rather than Crystal Palace for the reason of the season.

He told his VibeWithFive podcast: “We had Donny on the show a while back and I’ve been able to stay in contact and speak to him quite a lot and I spoke to him over this deal as well, over this period of time. Obviously Frank Lampard was a big driver but also (Palace boss) Patrick Vieira was a big driver for him because he respects both.

“But I think being able to stay at home still, in Manchester, not having to move, his girlfriend’s pregnant as well, these are factors that played a part as well.

“But also, I think the important thing for Donny van de Beek – yes to play games – but just as important is where he is going to be played.

“If you’re going to ask him to play the similar roles that he played at Man United, which is maybe a little bit more defensive at times, then you’re not going to get the best out of him.

“You have to give him license to go forward, license to attack the box, and judging him by what he did at Ajax he was allowed to get into the box and free rein to get in there and time his runs to get opportunities to score goals.

“He knows how to score, he knows how to play one- and two-touch in progressive, possession-based football.

“And Frank Lampard, in his short time as a manager, has tried to make his teams play football in a way that someone like Donny van de Beek might be able to flourish. I hope it works for both of them.”
