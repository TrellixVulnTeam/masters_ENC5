Mr Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said it was “time to resolve” the partygate issue and admitted the scandal was dragging the Conservative party into an “ugly place”.

He told Sky News that he wanted to break the “holding pattern” the party is currently in, claiming it was “horrible for all MPs to have to defend this to the British public”.

It came as Boris Johnson refused to confirm whether he would resign if fined by police for breaching Covid rules.

The prime minister told The Sun he would reveal whether he had received a fixed penalty notice - but declined to say whether he would offer his resignation as a result.

Elsewhere, Mr Johnson is facing fresh claims that he attended a leaving party held at No10 for a special adviser on January 14, 2021 at the height of the third lockdown. He is said to have given a short speech at the event and stayed for five minutes, the Guardian reported.
