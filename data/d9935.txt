A MUM is fuming after her ten-year-old daughter was left abandoned in the "dark and cold" by a bus driver due to a faulty ticket machine.

Daiva Paskeviciene was furious that the driver denied her daughter entry and says the crying schoolgirl had to ait alone for 40 minutes for another bus home.

The 10-year-old, who goes to Tollcross Primary School in Edinburgh, had taken a short walk to the bus stop to catch the number 34.

She claims that her daughter presented her junior bus pass that had been topped up that morning but was denied access.

The driver told her it wasn't working and said she would have to exit the bus leaving the youngster "terrified and upset".

Daiva told EdinburghLive: "She went to the bus with her bus card that I topped up that morning.

"The machine wasn't working so the driver told her she couldn't get on the bus. He then got angry and was shouting at her. She got really scared.

"The bus stop was at Lothian Road, she had to wait 40 minutes for the next one it got dark and very cold.

"She called me and eventually a stranger had to give her money to be able to get home. Next time I made sure she had spare change just in case.

"I couldn't believe a driver would act like that to a little girl then it happened again."

The incident happened on January 6 after schools had returned following the Christmas break.

A spokesman for Lothian Buses said: "Lothian is committed to delivering safe, reliable public transport for all of our customers.

"We would always ask that our customers contact our customer services team if they have concerns regarding their travel experience and would encourage this customer to contact us directly with more information to allow us to investigate the matter."
