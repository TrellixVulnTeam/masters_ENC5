Russia is encouraging citizens to seize the benefits of climate change by offering free land in the melting Arctic for eco-tourism including glamping.

Land plots in six Russian regions are on offer to citizens for the chance to develop “ecotourism” and “small and medium-sized businesses”.

Thousands of Russians have applied for ownership of part of the 1 million hectares (3860 square miles) currently available and the chance of voluntary resettlement.

Climate change has prompted a transformation in Russia’s far east and north. As temperatures rise, the land - and the possibility to cultivate it - has improved.

Russia Arctic region is heating more than twice as fast as the planet as a whole and was ravaged by wildfires last year. Scientists estimate that vast swathes of the permafrost in northern Russia is at risk of "dangerous" melting, with swamps and lakes are mushrooming around the region.

But Russian Arctic Hectare program is encouraging citizens further east as part of the country’s effort to take advantage of climate change and develop the region.

"The Arctic is different. There are places for eco-friendly recreation - for example, in Karelia and the Murmansk region, for tourism, development of small and medium-sized businesses,” said Alexei Chekunkov, the head of the Ministry for the Development of the Far East.

“It is important that the initiatives of active people at the local and regional level are based on additional support measures that reinforce the federal program."
