A reporter on Wednesday asked White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki if Joe Biden will pledge to nominate an Asian-American to the Supreme Court.

But Joe Biden isn’t woke enough because he didn’t nominate someone from the LGBTQIA community.

Joe Biden brought this upon himself when he made his SCOTUS pick about race.

“Given the President’s commitment to diversify [the Supreme Court], will be make similar pledges…for example, there’s never been an Asian-American justice or LGBTQ justice, so will he make a similar pledge?” CBS’s Weijia Jiang asked Psaki.
