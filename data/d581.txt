After falling down the pecking order under first Jose Mourinho and then Antonio Conte, the England international finally secured an exit during the dying embers of deadline day with an official announcement released just after midnight on February 1.

The 25-year-old has signed a two-and-a-half-year contract at Goodison Park and will be cup-tied for their FA Cup meeting with Brentford on Saturday.

In a frantic end to the window for Everton, Lampard was confirmed as Rafa Benitez’s successor earlier on deadline day alongside the loan addition of Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek.

“I’m delighted to have signed for Everton, a huge club with a great fanbase and history,” said Alli to the club’s official website.

“I’m eager to get started and can’t wait for my first game in an Everton shirt.

“I’m looking forward to helping the team and the opportunity to work with the new manager Frank Lampard.”
