Much of the territory now represented by Republican gubernatorial candidate U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin would shift to a more Democrat-friendly district spanning from the Hamptons to suburbs closer to New York City.

And the central New York district narrowly won by U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney, a Republican, will be spread among several districts. She'll now live in a Democratic-friendly district sweeping from the Hudson Valley, up to Albany and west to Binghamton and Utica. She's vowed to run against incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Antonio Delgado.

Democratic leaders have defended the maps as addressing the reality of New York's population shifts over the past decade: Democrat-dominated New York City gained 629,000 people in the 2020 Census, while rural upstate areas home to many Republicans saw populations shrink and shift to cities. New York lost its 27th congressional district because of lagging population growth.

“When you set up a commission with an equal number from both parties you'll get deadlock,” Gianaris said. "We're just dealing with the process that you handed us when we succeeded you in taking over the majority.”

“The people of this district elected me to represent them and to elevate their voices," said Mitaynes, who described her district as a “diverse, vibrant working class” community. "And right now that is what I'm doing.”

“Yes it’s true there were population losses upstate,” Li said. "But they also radically redrew a lot of the districts well beyond what they needed to do to account for population losses.”
