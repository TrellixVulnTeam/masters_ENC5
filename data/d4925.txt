BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A subsidiary of Bismarck-based MDU Resources Group Inc. said Tuesday it has completed expansion of a $260 million natural gas pipeline in western North Dakota.

State officials have hailed WBI Energy Inc.’s North Bakken Expansion project as a step toward curbing the wasteful flaring of excess gas, while increasing state tax revenues by allowing more oil drilling in the area.

Officials have said oil drilling in the area north of Lake Sakakawea is hamstrung by the lack of natural gas infrastructure.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission officials last summer approved a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the project, which adds 250 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to a pipeline network.

The company said the project includes construction of about 62 miles beginning in Tioga of 24-inch natural gas pipeline and 20 miles of 12-inch pipe, a new compressor station and additional infrastructure. The company said the project employed up to 450 people during construction.

The line would connect to the Northern Border Pipeline south of Watford City, where the gas would be sent to Iowa, Chicago and other markets.
