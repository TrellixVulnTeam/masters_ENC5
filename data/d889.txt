A scientist from the government’s top coronavirus advisory group has condemned Boris Johnson’s claim that schools are safe.

Prof Susan Michie, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the prime minister’s words were “untrue”.

Amid dire figures for Covid-19 infections (a record 53,135 were recorded on Tuesday), hospitalisations (five of England’s seven NHS regions currently have their highest ever number of patients) and deaths (981 were recorded on Wednesday, the highest since April), the government has been facing questions about the safety of reopening schools.

On Wednesday, education secretary Gavin Williamson delayed the reopening of England’s secondary schools until 11 January for exam year pupils and 18 January for other pupils. Most primary schools will reopen as planned next week.

Williamson said the secondary school delay was in response to the growing number of infections, but suggested “Covid infections among children are triggered by changes in the community rate” and that “we must continue to do all we can to keep children in school”.
