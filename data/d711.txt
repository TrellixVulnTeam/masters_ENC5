Tesla has been delivering phantom cars for years. Deliveries are always higher than production. Which could make sense of there was ever a production surplus. However, Tesla has never had a quarter where production was greater than the supposed deliveries.

The only explanation is that Tesla counts a deposit for a future car as a delivered vehicle in the current quarter.

Forward booking future revenue. There is a reason why every CFO quit.
