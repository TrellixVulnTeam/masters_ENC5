Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance is doing a fine job repelling the good folks in the state of Ohio. As Palmer Report has laid out, Vance (cat hater, insurrection party, Ohio) was recently endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene (insane, insurrection party, Georgia). And together, Little Red Riding Hood and the big bad wolf planned a visit.

This visit was to the Landing Event Center in Loveland, Ohio. Per Cincinatti.com, Vance was scheduled for an event there, and Green was to join him. Only someone forgot to tell the venue manager. Although the Center knew Vance was scheduled to be there, they apparently had no idea that Greene was also showing up.

And General Manager Jodi Taylor was stunned when she saw angry emails from Ohioans expressing their revulsion. Thank you, Ohio. Then the calls started. So the higher-ups at this venue huddled — and decided to cancel the event. It was relocated to the Marriott NE in Deerfield, Twp.

The event is still on at the time of this writing, but now Deerfield is also receiving messages from tons of outraged people asking this event be canceled.

This is what happens when one deliberately spreads hate and venom. I’ve no doubt the toxic twosome will find someplace to host them. Perhaps this event will stay in Deerfield; maybe it will be moved. But that’s not the point.

The point is Vance — and Greene — are pariahs. Yes, they have Maga, but Maga has shrunk and is firmly in the minority. Vance and Greene are laughing stocks — as they should be.
