Some Republicans are fine with judicial selections reflecting the population if a Republican president makes the appointment. Washington Post reported that Roger Wicker (R-MS) is calling President Biden’s desire to appoint a Black woman a form of affirmative action. His claim is ludicrous.

Appearing on a radio show Friday, Wicker railed about President Biden appointing “a left-wing judge,” but after being prodded by the host, Wicker grudgingly acknowledged that President Biden is fulfilling a campaign promise. Republicans don’t know anything about that as they don’t have the integrity necessary to keep promises. They just throw a lot of crap at the wall and wait to see if any of sticks enough to get them in office. Then, they immediately forget because they never really cared what their constituents wanted in the first place.

Wicker calls President Biden’s appointment “irony” because SCOTUS will be looking at affirmative action cases. There is no “irony” here, and the White House pointed that out to Wicker, though looking at him, Wicker appears old enough to remember President Ronald Reagan and his appointment of Sandra Day O’Connor because of his campaign pledge to appoint the first woman to the Supreme Court. At the time, Reagan said such appointment: “symbolized the American ideal that permits persons of any sex, age, or race, from every section and every walk of life to aspire and achieve in a manner never before even dreamed of in human history.”

If it was such a great thing for President Reagan to make a specific pledge and appointment, why is it any different for President Biden? Of course, there is no difference other than in the minds of some Republicans. The Biden White House further pointed to “president” Donald Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, whom this very same critic—Wicker—“hoped she would be an inspiration to his granddaughters.” We can only assume that Wicker does not care about inspiring little Black girls. While President Biden’s pledge is certainly not affirmative action, Wicker’s drive to keep a Black woman off the Court could well be considered racist. Why otherwise categorize the appointment of two women so differently?

Surprisingly, one Republican Senator sees things differently: Lindsey Graham. Graham appeared on Sunday’s “Face the Nation” and praised Judge J. Michelle Childs to the Heavens. Graham said that he “cannot think of a better person for President Biden to consider.” That statement alone says a lot, but he went on to dispute Wicker’s description of Biden’s selection as a “beneficiary of affirmative action.” Graham does not see Childs as such and said that she “is qualified by every measure.” Now, if Lindsay Graham can accept one of Biden’s nominees, why is it that Wicker cannot? Graham even went on to say that he is “in the camp of making sure the court and other institutions look like America.” This is the way that appointments should be. We all live here together, and we should all feel confident that we are represented on every level.
