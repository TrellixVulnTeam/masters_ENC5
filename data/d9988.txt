Shares in PayPal crashed by more than 25pc on Wednesday, knocking more than $50bn off its value after missing Wall Street growth forecasts.

The payments company revealed worse-than-expected guidance for the start of the year and said it had deleted millions of illegitimate accounts.

PayPal has been a major beneficiary of the pandemic, which moved shopping online, pushed out cash and increased consumer spending in the US due to massive government stimulus programmes.

It has also enjoyed more usage due to rising interest in cryptocurrency, which PayPal lets users invest in.

On Tuesday night the company said it expected revenues to rise by 15pc to 17pc this year, below forecasts of 17.9pc.

It said it had closed 4.5m accounts opened by “bad actors” who it said were taking advantage of incentives and financial rewards.

Last year PayPal began offering $10 credits to new users in an attempt to drive growth, but found that many were being opened by fraudsters.

The closures, and changes to focus on existing customers rather than new ones, led it to abandon a goal of having 750m active accounts by 2025. PayPal said rising inflation meant some customers were spending less.

The drop means PayPal has joined the list of companies whose shares soared during the pandemic but have fallen to trade around where they were before coronavirus lockdowns.

Peloton, Netflix and Zoom have also given up much of their pandemic gains.
