Tomorrow the new cap on energy prices is to be announced.

Analysts predict it will be almost 50% higher than the current one – difficult news for households braced for a cost-of-living squeeze.

But Channel 4 News understands that alongside the cap hike, will be a promise of a £200 rebate on energy bills.

It will cost the government billions – but poverty campaigners warn even that won’t be enough.
