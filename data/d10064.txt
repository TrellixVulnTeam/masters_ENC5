The nurse whistleblower interviewed here by Stew Peters works in the records department of a large California hospital. She says that in many cases, those who die of “Covid”, have chosen to check “organ donor” on their driver’s license. Makes me wonder if the Departments of Motor Vehicles publish lists for hospitals to recognize organ donors.

Think it over before becoming an “organ donor”. Might sound like a noble, altruistic, generous, kind, loving thing to do, but it (like anything else) can be misused, abused. Did you know that organs are a very profitable product? The US has long criticized China for harvesting organs from its political prisoners.

But even going to the hospital and being “treated” may lead to a diagnosis (however incorrect) of Covid, dangerous treatments, withdrawal of nutrition and premature death. Family members are not allowed to see or be with the patient and they are manipulated into signing a “do not resuscitate” order. The total compensation for a patient who is treated for and dies with Covid (not ‘due to Covid‘, but ‘with Covid’ – meaning a false positive test will suffice) is over $100,000. Some of that comes from insurance and the rest from your tax dollars. In addition to the $100,000 “treatment”, a fully-harvested human body is worth $65,000,000.

Hospitals are corporations, as you probably already know.
