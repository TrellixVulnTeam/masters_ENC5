Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Plates and mugs produced to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee are being sold as unusual collector's items due to misspelling the event as "Platinum Jubbly."

Website Wholesale Clearance said the dishes were made by a manufacturing company in China and were meant to be told in British stores for the queen's Platinum Jubilee, the celebration of her 70th year on the throne.
