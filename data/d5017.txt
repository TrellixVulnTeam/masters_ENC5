While Superman has gone woke, there’s a new superhero in town and her name is super granny!

All jokes, aside, a video that is making its rounds on social media showed a senior citizen single handily stopping an alleged shoplifter from stealing goods in Walmart.

The video takes place at a Walmart located in British Columbia, Canada, and depicts a senior citizen noticing a man nonchalantly pushing a cart full of unpaid goods out of Walmart.

The video gets intense quickly after the older woman noticed the man stealing the goods and in return, the old woman yanked the ski mask off the crook and then pulled his cart away from him.

Watch the moment it happened here:

Newsweek had these details to share:

brave elderly woman stopped an alleged shoplifter from leaving a Walmart store by ripping off his balaclava, according to reports. In a video uploaded to Facebook on Saturday, a man wearing a balaclava pushed a shopping cart filled with items towards the exit of a Canadian Walmart, according to CHEK. The man filming inside the Campbell River Walmart then asks the man in the ski mask if he plans to pay for his items, to which the alleged shoplifter said “yeah.” But as the alleged shoplifter moved towards the exit an elderly woman became suspicious of his motives, blocked his path out and ripped off his black ski mask. With his face revealed, the man left the store without the shopping cart and left the supermarket car park on a bicycle. Darrell Johansen, who uploaded the video to Facebook, said he alerted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and claimed other cases of stealing had happened at the Campbell River Walmart. In the post, Johansen said: “There’s nothing preventing private citizens from jumping in but it’s probably not recommended given the unfortunate incident that happened at our Walmart here a few months ago with that security guard getting stabbed. But I’ve just had it with this ****.”
