Miles Aldridge rose to prominence in the mid-90s with his arresting, highly stylised photographs referencing film noir, art history and pop culture. The exhibition Miles Aldridge: High-Gloss runs until 19 March at the Fahey Klein gallery in Los Angeles. The book, After Cattelan, documents Aldridgeâ€™s absurdist series with artist Maurizio Cattelan, shot during one night at La Monnaie de Paris.
