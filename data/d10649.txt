A man has been arrested after a 2-day-old baby went missing and her mother was shot to death. Memphis police said the baby, Kennedy Hoyle, has not been found, but evidence had led them to believe her father, Brandon Isabelle, killed her.

Isabelle is charged with two counts of first degree murder, one count of murder in the perpetration of aggravated kidnapping, especially aggravated kidnapping, and tampering or fabricating evidence, police said.

The mother was identified as Danielle Hoyle. Police still searching for the baby's remains.

Late Tuesday night, Memphis police said officers found an abandoned vehicle in Whitehaven, Tennessee. After investigating, police found a 27-year-old woman near the car who had been fatally shot.

In a press release, Memphis police said they were told the woman had the 2-year-old with her, but the baby was not found in the car.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an AMBER Alert for Kennedy Hoyle on Wednesday morning. The baby is 6 pounds and 17 inches long. When she was last seen, she was in the presence of her mother and wearing a black and white polka dot onesie with pink pants, according to police.

Family members told CBS affiliate WREG-TV that they last heard from Danielle Hoyle on Tuesday night as she was driving the baby to the hospital.

"I just want my grandbaby, and I want my daughter to come home. That's all I want. At least tell me what's going on," Hoyle's mother said. "They said they got like 50 police looking for her. My thing is everybody should be looking for her. She's a newborn."

Anyone who has seen a child fitting this description or has information about Kennedy's whereabouts is encouraged to call MPD at 901-545-2677 or TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND.
