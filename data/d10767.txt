“The prices are so high, with everyone still working on repairing houses,” Ms. Tran said. “And we still don’t have electricity.”

Ms. Tran can’t imagine passing the business along to her children. “We don’t want our kids to go through this,” she said.

The reluctance of young people to enter an industry that is more arduous and less lucrative than it was in past generations has left Louisiana with a vexing conundrum: While the seafood remains plentiful — the state still routinely ranks second to Alaska in seafood production — the will and expertise to harvest it is dwindling.

The phenomenon, known locally as “the graying of the fleet,” is aggravated by storms like Ida and reflected in the steep decline in the volume of shrimp and oysters caught since 2019. A recently released study by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and Louisiana State University estimates that the state’s $2.5 billion seafood industry suffered nearly $580 million in losses over the past two hurricane seasons.

More than half of the losses came from damage to infrastructure that may never be repaired. In November, Robert Collins, 62, the third-generation owner of Louisiana Dried Shrimp Company, stared into the sky from the floor of his waterside facility in Grand Isle, one of the most vulnerable communities on Louisiana’s coast. Ida had torn off nearly all of the roof.

“I’m not going to use my retirement savings to fix this,” he said. Last week, Mr. Collins said his business was still closed and that he was uncertain if it would ever reopen.
