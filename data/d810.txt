Boris Johnson is heading to Ukraine where tens of thousands Russian soldiers maintain their close position to the border – after he missed a ‘vital’ diplomatic call with president Vladimir Putin.

Hours after another crisis unfolded in the Commons over Sue Gray’s report into Downing Street parties, the Tory leader packed his bags for Kyiv leaving some to wonder if this is a gambit to save his premiership.

Ahead of his planned trip to the region amid rising tensions in Europe, he was also due to speak with the Russian leader to reiterate the need for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

But a planned phone call between the two was cancelled as Mr Johnson dealt with the fallout from the so-called ‘partygate’ row.

Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy highlighted the situation in Ukraine is so ‘immensely serious’ that it needs a ‘focused’ prime minister, not one ‘so distracted by defending the indefensible that he missed a vital diplomatic call with Putin’.

Deputy prime minister Dominic Raab rushed to Mr Johnson’s defence, saying there are ‘always scheduling issues between any two heads of government’.

In Kyiv, the prime minister will hold talks with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy about what strategic support Britain can offer amid fears of an all-out invasion from the Kremlin.

It comes as Number 10 confirmed Britain will give £88 million of aid to support stable governance and reduce Ukraine’s reliance on Russian energy supplies.

The prime minister said: ‘It is the right of every Ukrainian to determine how they are governed.

‘As a friend and a democratic partner, the UK will continue to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty in the face of those who seek to destroy it.

‘We urge Russia to step back and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic resolution and avoid further bloodshed.’

Foreign secretary Liz Truss was forced to miss the talks after she tested positive for Covid-19 last night.

Yesterday, she held up to her promise and unveiled unprecedented strengthening of the UK’s sanctions regime in the event Russia invaded Ukraine.

The new legislation allows the government to sanction a much broader range of oligarchs and businesses because of their significance to the Kremlin.

In a statement to the Commons, Ms Truss said it would not penalise automatically but provide for additional powers ‘in the event of any further Russian incursion into Ukraine’.

She said: ‘We will make sure that those who share responsibility for the Kremlin’s aggressive and destabilising action will share in bearing a heavy cost.’
