For Elizabeth Snow-Murphy, who moved to the Atlanta suburbs in 2015, the first Ossoff campaign became a valuable training ground for her and other volunteers, many of whom assumed their communities were either politically apathetic or dominated by Republicans.

“We were able to build networks,” said Ms. Snow-Murphy, 38, who works in sales and now helps run a liberal grass-roots organization in the Sixth District. “It motivated a lot of people and mobilized us, but it also trained an entire army of grass-roots volunteers.”

Phone banks to help the effort sprang up from Los Angeles to New York. Alyssa Milano and other celebrities descended on the district and solicited campaign donations on social media. The actor Samuel L. Jackson even cut a radio ad excoriating Mr. Trump that was aired in the district.

Mr. Ossoff’s effort inspired the hundreds of local liberal organizations, largely organized by suburban women, that formed after Mr. Trump’s victory. Many began as private Facebook groups or small wine clubs, with names like the Women of Bus One in suburban Pennsylvania, or GrassRoots Resistance in suburban Ohio, where women shared their dismay over Hillary Clinton’s defeat.

For many of these groups, Mr. Ossoff’s race became an early rallying cry — and an opportunity to open their wallets. The progressive blog Daily Kos calculated that Mr. Trump had won Georgia’s Sixth District by just one percentage point in 2016; in previous years, Republicans had won by double digits there. When Mr. Ossoff announced his campaign with an endorsement from Representative John Lewis, the civil rights leader, Daily Kos endorsed him as well. Within a week, it had raised $400,000 for Mr. Ossoff from its readers — more than it had raised for any candidate in any election cycle up to that point.

“We didn’t know how our community and how progressives in general were feeling,” said David Nir, the Daily Kos political director. “Did the grass roots want to get involved? The answer was there was so much pent-up energy ready to explode.”
