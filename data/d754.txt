What do you do when seconds count, but help is minutes away? Congresswoman-elect Lauren Boebert knows the answer to that question.

For one thing, the help she would call on is measured in feet per second. Now that’s our kind of girl.

Not that this should surprise anyone who’s been paying attention.

We’ve had our eye on this one for months now, and she’s been rock solid on her defiance of the authoritarians and gun-grabbers.

A restaurant owner and staunch defender of the Second Amendment, Boebert plans to protect herself by providing her own security. Even in a year with widespread pandemic-related shutdowns in the city, homicides have risen roughly 20% over 2019, and the violent crime rate is 158% higher than the national average, Boebert said in an interview on “Just the News AM.” “I don’t go to work in an armored vehicle, I don’t have a police escort,” Boebert told show host Carrie Sheffield. “I am my security … I need a way to protect myself. We are grateful for our law enforcement officers, but I can’t count on them to be there every second of the day.” –JustTheNews

She goes on to make a very sensible point about the people who called for the policing cuts that precipitated these urban crime waves is the same group that gets their panties in a twist over gun owners taking safety into their own hands.

How many times have you heard some version of that argument … ‘You don’t need a gun, just call the police.’

Uh… can these people even HEAR themselves?

In Doug Giles’ latest book, Biblical Badasses: The Women, Giles spotlights ten epic ladies who did awesome things for God with the odds severely stacked against them. These girls weren’t your typical church ladies. They were holy movers and shakers who upset hell with their God-honoring, faith-filled, lives. Giles’ unique take on these terrific women makes the scripture come alive. This book is real, raw, relevant, and irreverent. Giles’ prayer is that after reading, Biblical Badasses: The Women, not only will your noggin be filled with these amazing tales of high and lows from real women who rocked in a hard place, via the power of God, but that you will get off your butt, quit pursuing stupidity, start chasing down your high calling and at the end of your life, you too, like the holy femme fatales featured herein, will have left a massive scar on Satan’s haggard backside.
