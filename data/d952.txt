ikel Arteta is confident Bukayo Saka will shake off the injury he suffered at Brighton and be fit to face West Brom on Saturday.

Saka was forced to come off during Tuesday’s 1-0 win at the Amex Stadium but the 19-year-old is expected to recover in time for the trip to the Hawthorns.

Arteta said: “I hope he is available. We will see with training on Thursday or not. He has played a lot of minutes. I am confident he will be OK.”

Saka has been in brilliant form in recent weeks and his fitness would be a huge boost for Arsenal as they bid to build on back-to-back wins against Chelsea and Brighton.

Arteta said: “The biggest thing that Bukayo has done in the past few months is the personality he plays with, the responsibility he takes, the decisions he is willing to make when things are not going well, and the impact he has had on the team to get results.

“That, at that age, is not common at all. But that is in his nature. He wants to evolve that. You can see his team-mates trust him and his team want to give him that responsibility.

“It is a great example for young players, to play with that commitment and that passion, but as well with that courage.”
