Some of Britain's biggest businesses have been named and shamed after being caught paying staff below the minimum wage.

Tesco, Pizza Hut, Costco and Superdrug were among those the Government exposed as underpayers.

But they were far from alone, with 139 businesses all caught breaking the rules on how much staff legally have to earn between 2016 and 2018.

That meant overall 95,000 workers lost out £6.7million, while workers were handed more than £1,000 back each in some cases.

Business Minister Paul Scully told The Mirror: “The companies we’re naming and shaming today need to make an urgent New Year’s resolution – pay your workers the minimum wage.

“In 2021 and beyond, we will continue to catch and name companies that fail to pay the minimum wage, ensuring millions of workers across the UK take home the pay packet they are entitled to.”

It's the first time the Government has named and shamed companies for failing to pay National Minimum Wage since 2018, after changes to the process to make sure only the worst offenders are targeted.

Scully said: “Paying the minimum wage is not optional, it is the law.

"It is never acceptable for any employer to short-change their workers, but it is especially disappointing to see huge household names who absolutely should know better on this list."

Bosses caught paying people too little have to pay back arrears of wages to the worker at current minimum wage rates.

They also face penalties of up to 200% of arrears - capped at £10,000 a worker - which are paid to the Government.

One of the main reasons employees lost out was by being made to cover work costs such as uniforms, training or parking fees.

Some employers also failed to raise employees’ pay after they had a birthday that should have moved them into a different National Minimum Wage bracket.

Not all breaches of minimum wage rules are intentional, the Government said, but that doesn't change the fact money is owed.

"It is the responsibility of all employers to ensure they are following the law," the department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.

Tesco said: “In 2017 we identified a technical issue that meant some colleagues’ pay inadvertently fell below the national minimum.

“We are very sorry this happened and reported it at the time to HMRC.

“All colleagues were reimbursed in full, in most cases £10 or less, and we immediately changed our policies to prevent a recurrence.

“We are therefore extremely disappointed and surprised to be on this list as none of the examples shared by BEIS relate to Tesco.”

Bosses legally have to pay workers the following rates:
• Aged 25 or over - £8.72 an hour

Pizza Hut said: “Years ago, with many firms in the sector, HMRC made us aware of a policy error. In 2018 we completed a pay adjustment for current and ex-staff.

“There was never intent to underpay our employees. We advocate the principles that underpin minimum pay and are confident the processes have been fixed.”

Shop workers’ union Usdaw said: “Tesco has always paid well over the minimum and this underpayment was a technical issue, now resolved.

“But too many employers deliberately pay below the minimum rates.”

Economist Hannah Slaughter, of the Resolution Foundation, said: “Re-

starting the naming and shaming regime to tackle guilty firms should be a catalyst for levelling up low pay.”
