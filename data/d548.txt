The 25-year-old midfielder joined Everton on deadline day in a deal that could cost up to £30million.

Everton negotiated an unusual deal with Spurs to sign Dele on a free with £10m payable after 20 appearances, and the eventual fee could rise to over triple that, over a two-and-a-half-year contract.

Dele departs Tottenham after 269 games in seven years at the club. He joined Spurs from MK Dons in the summer of 2015 and established himself as one of the most exciting young players in Europe, but gradually fell from favour and struggled under each of his managers since Mauricio Pochettino was sacked.

He made just seven Premier League appearances for Tottenham this season and Antonio Conte made it clear he was available for transfer in January. But Dele is hoping to reignite his career under Frank Lampard at Everton.

“I've had a few good conversations with [Lampard] already and he's a player I've admired watching his whole career,” he told Sky Sports.

“To get the opportunity to work with him now is very exciting and I'm sure we're going to do great things together.

“I just want to be happy playing football and working with [Lampard] and the great players they've got there.

“I think it's is a great opportunity to do that. I'm excited to go there and show the fans what I can do and help the club as much as I can.”
