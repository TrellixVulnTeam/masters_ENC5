Feb. 1 (UPI) -- A shooting Tuesday at Bridgewater College in northern Virginia left two campus officers dead and a suspect in custody, local authorities said.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced the arrest of a suspect around 2 p.m.

"The shooter is in custody and state and local police are on the scene. I will continue to monitor the situation in conjunction with law enforcement," Youngkin said in a tweet.

Bridgewater College lifted its shelter in place order around 4:30 p.m.

The school's president, David W. Bushman, said Campus Police officer John Painter and Campus Safety officer J.J. Jefferson were killed during the attack.

"These officers were close friends, known to many of us as the 'dynamic duo,'" Bushman said in a statement posted to the school's website. "John was J.J.'s best man in his wedding this year. They were beloved by students, faculty and staff. I hurt for their families and loved ones, as I know we all do."

The Virginia State Police, Harrisonburg Police Department, FBI, Virginia Department of Emergency Management, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives responded to the scene.

Witness Ecliff Graves told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he saw the suspect running away from the college carrying a duffle bag over his shoulder.

"Whatever he had in that bag was very heavy," Graves said.
