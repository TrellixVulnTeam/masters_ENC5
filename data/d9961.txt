SHELLSHOCKED Aaron Ramsey looked on as Celtic thrashed his new Rangers side to go top of the Scottish Premiership.

The former Arsenal star, 31, sealed a deadline-day loan move to Ibrox from Juventus but was forced to sit in the stands after being deemed not fit enough to play.

And Ramsey may want to board the first flight back to Turin as a Reo Hatate double followed by Liel Abada’s strike saw the Bhoys race into a 3-0 lead by half-time.

Ramsey wore a stunned expression as the Hoops took the lead in the fourth minute and never looked back.

The Wales midfield superstar revealed he rejected several Premier League clubs - including Newcastle, Crystal Palace and Burnley - to make his surprise deadline-day move north of the border.

But the former Gunners ace looked miserable as the grim scene unfolded around him at Celtic Park.

Japanese star Hatate showed no nerves on his Old Firm debut as he rifled into the side netting after five minutes.

The midfielder then added another cracker as he rolled one past Allan McGregor with minutes to go to the interval.

And seconds before the break it was over as Abada stabbed home Hatate’s cross.

Rangers failed to test Joe Hart in the Celtic net in a first loss for Giovanni van Bronckhorst as boss.

The win sees Celtic end their winless seven-game Old Firm run as they leapfrog their rivals to the top of the Scottish Premiership by one point.

Just 48 hours earlier, Ramsey had bigged up his decision to join Gers.

He told the club website: "I had a number of offers on the table, but none matched the magnitude of this club, with European football and the chance to play in front of 50,000 fans every other week.

“I have had some fantastic conversations with the manager and Ross Wilson, and I’m really looking forward to working with both of them, and to meeting the supporters.”
