CNN anchor Brian Stelter on Wednesday said Chris Cuomo was trying to ‘burn the place down’ and was going reveal incriminating information on Jeff Zucker and his paramour, Allison Gollust.

Mr. Zucker’s relationship with Allison Gollust, the chief marketing officer for CNN, was revealed during an investigation into Chris Cuomo’s sexual misconduct.

According to reports, Zucker’s relationship with Gollust was an “open secret” so what’s the real reason for Zucker’s sudden resignation?

CNN’s Brian Stelter said ousted anchor Chris Cuomo was threatening to burn in all down and reveal incriminating info on Zucker and Gollust.

Politico reported that Chris Cuomo is still negotiating his exit from CNN after he was fired last month.

Cuomo is fighting for his $18 million severance after getting fired so he used the incriminating information he has on Zucker and Gollust as leverage in court.

“[Cuomo] is not going out quietly. He was fired and there were reports that he wasn’t going to get paid millions of dollars that were gonna be on the remainder of his contract…he was trying to burn the place down! He was going to court, trying to burn the place down and claiming that he had incriminating information about Zucker and Gollust,” Stelter said.
