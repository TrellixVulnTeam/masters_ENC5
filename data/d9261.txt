"Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon fighters based at RAF Lossiemouth supported by a Voyager from RAF Brize Norton were scrambled today against unidentified aircraft approaching the UK area of interest. Subsequently we intercepted and escorted four Russian Bear aircraft," the spokesperson said. 'Bear' is the NATO reporting name for the Tupolev Tu-95, a nuclear-capable strategic bomber introduced into the Soviet Air Force in the mid-1950s and upgraded repeatedly.
