Apple has built an 'invisible wall' on its Maps service to hide boss Tim Cook's house from the public.

Both Apple Maps and Google Maps now blur out or entirely pixelate the Apple CEO's modest £2.5 million home in Palo Alto, California, according to CultOfMac.

The change comes after Apple successfully applied for a restraining order against an alleged stalker who referred to Tim Cook as 'my husband, my twins' daddy'.

The 45-year-old woman from Virginia is now not allowed to own a gun, travel within 200 yards of Cook or any other Apple employees, or go to any Apple property or Cook's home.

The woman allegedly tagged Cook and other tech CEOs in a number of tweets, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, telling them to 'unfollow' each other.

“I notify you both unfollow each other,” one of the tweets said. “I can smell, see, and feel both of you. Tim Cook is my bed man. My husband, my twins’ daddy. Stop doing that s**t!”

She also referred to Cook, 61, as "my cleaning MAN", "my bathroom MAN", and "my bed MAN" in other tweets. Tim Cook came out publicly as gay in 2014.

In Apple's petition for a restraining order, it claims that the woman emailed Cook around 200 times with photos of what appeared to be loaded handguns and showed up at his house. She even started registering fake companies under Cook's name, it is alleged.

In one email, she wrote: "I warned and told you stop trying to kill me. You made me to buy this instead of going for Christmas. I will NEVER forgive forget you."

The temporary restraining order was filed by Santa Clara County Superior Court ahead of a court hearing on March 29.

Google Maps has taken similar action in the past, notably to blur out Billie Eilish's home after she successfully obtained a restraining order against an apparent stalker.
