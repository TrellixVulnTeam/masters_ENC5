U.K. OKs Use of Third, Less Expensive COVID-19 Vaccine

Health Editor’s Note: Britain today authorized the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. While the two first approved vaccines must be kept in ultracold freezers until used, this third vaccine can be stored in normal refrigerators for 6 months and thus will be far easier to be dispensed. Also, the U.K. has decided to delay holding vaccines to be used for the second dose which completes the COVID-19 vaccination process and using these doses for first doses. Amazingly, this vaccine costs only $3 to $4 a dose.

Let’s hope that the rest of the world follows suit…..Carol
