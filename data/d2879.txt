A prolific partnership during the glory days of the Mauricio Pochettino era for Spurs, Kane and Dele combined for 33 goals in 233 matches together for both club and country and embodied their fresh generation of stars who competed for the Premier League and Champions League.

Dele, however, fell out of form under first Jose Mourinho and then Nuno Espirito Santo before Antonio Conte became the manager to oversee his departure.

Signing a two-and-half-year-deal at Goodison Park, the England international had posted a heartfelt comment of his own earlier on Tuesday in which he bid farewell to Tottenham fans.

Kane followed suit later in the day and wished the 25-year-old luck in the new chapter of his career.

“Good luck on your next chapter @dele_official,” read the message.

“We’ve had some great memories together over the past 7 years. Thank you for everything you have given me and the club! See you soon.”
