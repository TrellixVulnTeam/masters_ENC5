Households are facing an extra £180 to their annual grocery bill after inflation has seen prices surge in recent months.

The latest four-week grocery price inflation stands at 3.8 per cent, a 0.3 percentage point rise from December, according to the latest market data from Kantar.

Take-home supermarket sales dropped 3.8 per cent over the 12 weeks to 23 January 2022, compared to the year before when lockdown measures meant people were not dining at restaurants.

Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: “Prices are rising on many fronts, and the weekly shop is no exception. Like-for-like grocery price inflation, which assumes that shoppers buy exactly the same products this year as they did last year, increased again this month.

He added: “We’re now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions. Supermarkets that can offer the best value stand to win the biggest slice of spend.”
