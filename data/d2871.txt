Yes lovebirds (and happily singlebirds), the universal day of lurve takes place this month, and whether you celebrate the day with your partner or take it as an opportunity to spread some love to friends and family, it’s never a day that slips by without mention.

These days, before and after February 14 is an event too, with Galentine’s, first referenced in the comedy series Parks & Recreation, and Singles Awareness Day taking place on the 13th and 15th respectively. Whether you’re happily coupled up, blissfully single, or somewhere in-between, what this means is that a drink is in order.

Dry Jan is in our rearview and for the millions who abstained, Valentine’s Day may present the first real opportunity to raise a glass and toast love. And what tastes better than your first real drink all year? One that’s on sale, of course.

You’ll find plenty to whet your whistle in this month’s booze deals roundup. From celebratory bottles of bubbles, plentiful plonk, and like gin, whisky and vodka, there are offers galore to bag for home delivery.

We’ve done the thirsty work and rounded them up for you below by category: beer, wine and spirits.
