MICHELLE McManus has revealed she gave birth to a little boy last month.

The 41-year-old Pop Idol star shared a picture of her second child today and revealed that she and husband Jeff have named him Nicholas.

Alongside the snap, she wrote: “Goodbye January 2022 👏 although I don’t know how any other month this year could possibly top you as you’re the month we welcomed the newest addition to our family 👶🏻❤

“Please say hello to Nicholas Peter Nimmo. You are so perfect in every way and we’re just so madly in love with you.

"Thank you for completing our family and our world. Love Mummy, Daddy and Harry 💙💙💙💙 #love #family #newarrival #babyboy #babybrother.”

Michelle married Jeff in 2017 at a stunning wedding ceremony, before celebrating their marriage in a second bash in Glasgow at the start of 2018.

The pair's first son, Harry John Nimmo, was born in January 2020.

Michelle shot to fame after winning Pop Idol in 2004 with hit-single All This Time and even set-up her own music label, McMannii Records.

She released her only album, The Meaning of Love, in February of the same year as it skyrocketed to number three in the charts.

The star has made a long line of string of TV appearances, including on BBC sitcom Still Game and Scottish lifestyle show The Hour.

After her marriage and birth of her first son, she got back into the music industry with a new band - The Flaming Blackhearts.
