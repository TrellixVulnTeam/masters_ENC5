Three lots of Wish-Bone Thousand Island Dressing and one lot of Wish-Bone Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing have been recalled by Conagra Brands.

The Conagra-written, FDA-posted recall notice on Friday says the four pulled lots have egg, but that allergen isn’t listed among the ingredients. No problem for most people, but “people who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to egg run the risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products.”

This covers lot Nos. 4254200620, best by Jan. 31, 2023, and 4254200720, best by Feb. 1, 2023, of Thousand Island salad dressing in 15-ounce bottles and lot No. 4254201720, best by Feb. 1, 2023 in 24-ounce bottles; and lot No. 4254201320 of Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing in 24-ounce bottles.

If you have the salad dressings and there’s the possibility they’ll be served to someone with an egg allergy, trash them or return them to the store where they were bought for a full refund.

If you have questions, call Conagra at 800-881-3989, Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Eastern time or email the company at Consumer.Care@conagra.com.
