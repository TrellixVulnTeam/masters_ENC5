And SunSport have collected the best free bets and sign up offers available from our bookmaker partners and listed them below!

France enter the 2022 Six Nations as favourites to collect their first title since 2010.

Betfair have priced Fabien Galthie's side -- who finished as runners-up in both 2020 and 2021 -- at 6/4 to finally deliver after some scintillating performances.

England and Ireland are considered Les Bleus' closest challengers, sharing odds of 11/4.

Eddie Jones is without captain Owen Farrell, who has been ruled out of the entire tournament with an ankle problem but remains bullish about England's prospects.

Scotland haven't won the competition since landing the the final edition of the Five Nations in 1999 and are 10/1 to end their drought.

Wales (12/1) stormed to a Triple Crown title in last year’s Six Nations but are without several key players including Ken Owens and Alun Wyn Jones.

Italy are available at a bumper 500/1 having had six consecutive last-place finishes in the Six Nations.
