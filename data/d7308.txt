Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Senate lawmakers on Thursday said the federal government must do more to prevent price gouging and other scams targeting consumers seeking protection against COVID-19.

During a hearing titled "Stopping COVID-19 Fraud and Price Gouging" on Thursday afternoon, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection, product safety and data security, said he has received 800 reports of price gouging in his state of Connecticut alone while stating a "lack of sufficient authority" in the federal government is a major cause of the problem.
