SIX the Musical is touring across the UK in 2022 – and tickets are already on sale.

The award-winning, Tudor extravaganza will headline venues across the country with a brand new cast.

The musical follows the six wives of the infamous Henry VIII who take to the stage to tell their stories in a pop concert inspired by some of the biggest modern day artists.

The show features the likes of Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour who tell their story against the backdrop of songs including “Don’t Lose Ur Head”, “Get Down” and “All You Wanna Do”.

The new touring Queens will be played by Chlöe Hart (Catherine of Aragon), Jennifer Caldwell (Anne Boleyn), Casey Al-Shaqsy (Jane Seymour), Aiesha Pease (Anna of Cleves), Jaina Brock-Patel (Katherine Howard) and Alana M Robinson (Catherine Parr).

The cast will also be backed by the show’s all-female band, The Ladies in Waiting.

SIX the Musical has become a breakout hit since its 2017 debut and is produced by Lucy Moss and Toby Marlow, with the former becoming the youngest female Broadway director in herstory.

The show debuted at Edinburgh Fringe Festival and went on to open on Broadway, tour Australia and New Zealand and is currently enjoying its third royal residence in the West End.

It’s been nominated for five Olivier Awards including Best New Musical and Best Supporting Actress for the original six stars of the musical.

Tickets for Liverpool, Glasgow, Aylesbury, Brighton and Bristol are available from ATGTickets.com.
