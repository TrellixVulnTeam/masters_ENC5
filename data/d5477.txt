And before we continue, so that you can get a better idea of how your own period experience might compare to ours, here's a small rundown of what our periods are like:

Farrah's period: My period tends to run light on the first day but sure brings the worst cramps and pain. My second day is always, always the heaviest in terms of bleeding and clotting. I’d guess I run through 7–9 regular tampons on day two. By day three, things start to slow down, and my day four is pretty light!

Lara's period: After quitting birth control many years ago and having two surgeries to treat my endometriosis and adenomyosis, my flow has changed a lot. It's less heavy than it used to be all the way through, but I generally have a heavy flow that would go through super tampons the first 1–3 days minimum. I also experience a pretty decent amount of clotting, which made me skeptical about period underwear in general at first. But after 4-plus years of using period underwear exclusively, I've never looked back!
