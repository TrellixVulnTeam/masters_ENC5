Manchester United's new chief executive Richard Arnold formally started his new role on Tuesday, with interim manager Ralf Rangnick trying to steer the club into a Champions League place.

United also remain in the Champions League and FA Cup, with the search for their next full-time manager likely to shape a pivotal summer.

Here, Northern Football Correspondent James Ducker assesses the problem areas facing Arnold and any new manager.

Manchester United’s hunt for a permanent manager will gather pace now the transfer window has closed and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has finally stepped down, 10 months after his resignation. Richard Arnold formally commenced his role as United’s new chief executive yesterday and the club want Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s long-term successor in place once the season is over, with Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag among the names in the frame.

He will be landed with one of the most challenging rebuilds the club has faced since Sir Alex Ferguson retired nine years ago, with one well-placed United source describing the situation as a “melting pot of problems”. There is uncertainty over the immediate futures of up to 12 players. Five of those are out of contract at the end of the season, including Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Juan Mata and a disillusioned Jesse Lingard, who has been given a few days off after being left angered at not getting a loan move to Newcastle or West Ham. Pogba is understood to have been urged by United to delay a decision on his future until the France midfielder knows who the new manager is.
