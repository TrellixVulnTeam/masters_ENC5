OTTAWA â€” All parties in the House of Commons agree that Canada must stand in solidarity with Ukraine but they're in sharp disagreement over how best to do that.

In an emergency debate Monday night on Russia's military buildup along its border with Ukraine, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated his government's commitment to expand and extend a military training mission in Ukraine, provide a $120-million loan and other non-lethal equipment, as well as development and humanitarian aid.

"Canada has a long history of standing up to bullies but standing up to bullies doesn't mean that we want conflict," he told the Commons.

Trudeau also reiterated his government's commitment to work with allies in Europe and the NATO military alliance to impose co-ordinated sanctions on Russia, should it invade Ukraine.

"We're always stronger together and we won't be intimidated," he said.
