Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education released its annual rankings on Wednesday of what it says are the worst U.S. colleges and universities for free speech.

Founded in 1999, the civil liberties organization aims to "defend and sustain" individual rights of students and faculty at American institutions of higher education -- including freedom of speech and association, due process and religious liberty.
