Some 27 people have been charged for allegedly causing a violent riot during a vigil for a teenager who had died suddenly.

Ethan Powell was 19 when he unintentionally overdosed in the home he shared with his grandma on May 18 last year, an inquest heard on Monday.

His community, in the Mayhill area of Swansea, Wales, held a vigil for him two days later but it quickly turned ugly.

Rioters lobbed rocks at the police and were filmed setting cars on fire, and crowds cheered as a vehicle was rolled down a steep hill.

Seven officers suffered scratches and bruises when they were pelted with missiles but did not require hospital treatment.

Officers are still investigating what the ‘trigger’ was for the violence.

All of those arrested, aged between 15 and 44, have been charged with offences including rioting and arson with intent to endanger life.

They are due to appear at Swansea Magistrates’ Court in March.

Chief Superintendent Trudi Meyrick said: ‘The investigation team were resolute in their commitment to fully investigate the disorder that happened that night.

‘Residents of Mayhill were subjected to terrible scenes of disorder which caused serious harm and distress to the community.

‘The judicial process will now run its course and we await the outcome of that process.’

South Wales Police (SWP) publicly apologised last month after locals said it took officers too long to respond to their calls for help and that they had felt ‘abandoned’.

An independent inquiry previously found there had been ‘significant failings’ by the force and recommended it carries out a more thorough investigation into its actions that night.
