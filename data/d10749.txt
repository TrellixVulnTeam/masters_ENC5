Stockholm, Sweden – After Neil Young has made headlines for removing his music from Spotify in protest of Joe Rogan’s COVID misinformation, Vanilla Ice has removed his music in the hopes someone will notice.

“I’m really hoping to get some press going,” said Robert Winkle, who goes by the stage name Vanilla Ice when someone lets him on stage. “This whole story has gotten pretty big and I want to make this whole thing a little more ice… like Vanilla Ice… I’m Vanilla Ice.”

Neil Young’s selfless actions have inspired talented artists like Joni Mitchell to join, and the positive press he’s received has inspired unpopular artists like Smash Mouth to boycott as well.

“I don’t even need many more people to listen to our music,” said Scott Stapp, lead singer of Creed. “I just hope Spotify will finally pay attention to us. Feeling like Spotify just doesn’t care about me all the time is just rough. I didn’t ask to be born!”

While Neil Young has expressed his gratefulness for all the support, he has again asked that the shittier artists stop joining the boycott and making it, “lamer.”

“I don’t mean to be a bully, but I just don’t really want to hang out with all these nerds,” stated Neil Young on his Forever Young blog. “If like Lil’ Nas or Dave Growl boycotts that‘d be really fuckin’ sweet. But Nickelback keeps texting me and I’ve just been ducking their calls like, dude, no fuckin’ losers in my boycott okay?”

In order to cash in on the positive reception of the boycott, Joe Rogan announced he will also be boycotting his own podcast as a thinly veiled attempt to improve his image. Neil Young has responded but saying, “this is exactly what I was talking, I repeat, no fuckin’ dorks!”
