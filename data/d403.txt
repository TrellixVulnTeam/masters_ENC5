“The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues that President Trump linked together just because Democrats are afraid to address two of them,” Mr. McConnell said.

“They’re hoping everyone just forgets about election integrity and big tech,” he said. “They’re desperate to ignore those two parts of President Trump’s request.”

Mr. Trump, however, continued to push for quick action on increasing checks.

“$2000 ASAP!” he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

While millions of Americans remain out of work, many economists say that increasing the checks to $2,000 from $600 would most likely have a negligible impact on stimulating the economy since a significant chunk of those receiving payments are likely to save, not spend, the funds. The stimulus payments are based on income levels, not job status. Democrats had pushed for an extra $600 per week in jobless benefits, since that money would go directly to those out of work, but Republicans rejected that request, saying it would discourage people from seeking employment.

On Monday, the House approved a bill increasing the checks to $2,000, and Democrats in the Senate have been urging Mr. McConnell to allow a similar vote. After Mr. McConnell concluded his remarks on Wednesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, again tried to hold an immediate vote on the House bill, arguing that with just days left in the legislative session and the House out of session, “there is no other game in town.”

“At the very least, the Senate deserves the opportunity for an up-or-down vote,” Mr. Schumer said, calling Mr. Trump “our unlikely ally.” Mr. McConnell again blocked his request, as he did on Tuesday.

Mr. Schumer and other Democrats warned that they would not support any effort to combine Mr. Trump’s three demands into one piece of legislation.
