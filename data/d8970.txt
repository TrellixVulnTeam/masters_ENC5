White House press secretary Jen Psaki talks about the decision to send about 2,000 U.S. troops from Fort Bragg, North Carolina to Poland and Germany this week, saying they are in addition to the 8,500 troops already on heightened alert that the President announced last week.

Watch Psaki’s remarks in the player above.

Psaki says the troops will “not be fighting in Ukraine,” rather they are being sent to reassure U.S. allies and the deployment is consistent with what other NATO allies, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Denmark, are also doing.

The military deployments come amid stalled talks with Russia over its military buildup at Ukraine’s borders.
