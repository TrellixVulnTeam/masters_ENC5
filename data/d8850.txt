A recent ‘road rage’ incident ended in a terrifying wreck on a New Jersey highway, according to reports.

The episode unfolded on the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey.

Dash cam footage of the crash was uploaded to YouTube on January 27.

“Accord and Raptor decided to road rage each other. Accord lost,” user 

Racerwong.Shooterwong explained in the caption. “Originally I was hoping to catch them doing something stupid approaching a speed trap/cop ahead displayed on Waze. This was unexpected.”

“Palisades Parkway Police told me the guy was ‘ok.’ Don’t have any further details.”

In the video, a Honda Accord sedan and Ford Raptor pickup truck can be seen jockeying for position on a busy highway consisting of two lanes traveling in the same direction.

The Accord swerves back and forth as the pickup seems to speed up and slow down in an effort to block the sedan from passing.

Eventually, the road expands to three lanes and the Accord surges forward in the empty right lane before attempting to fly back across and pass between another car and the Raptor.

While threading the needle, the Accord appears to brush against the Raptor, causing the driver to overcorrect and lose control.

The sedan swerves in front of the innocent third car and slams into a rock wall, spinning through the air and ultimately skidding along on its roof before coming to a stop.

While the YouTube user reports authorities told him the driver of the Accord survived, it is unclear what happened to the occupant(s) of the Raptor.
