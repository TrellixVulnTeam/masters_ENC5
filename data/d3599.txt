“President Joe Biden is expected to nominate career foreign service officer Bridget Brink to serve as his ambassador,” the AP reports.

“Brink, currently serving as the U.S. ambassador to Slovakia, will assume the long vacant diplomatic post at a moment when the U.S. and its allies remain on high alert, with some 100,000 Russian troops massed near Ukraine’s border.”
