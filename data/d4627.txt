FANS of The Responder were left in hysterics tonight - thanks to a drunk vicar called 'Liam Neeson'.

The character almost crashed his car into police officers Chris Carson and Rachel Hargreaves before falling out of the door with his trousers down.

Chris, played by Martin Freeman, was shocked to see a dog collar on the drunkard. Rachel - played by Adelayo Adedayo - then learned his name was the same as the famous Hollywood actor, Liam Neeson.

Irish star Liam is best known for starring in blockbusters Taken, Schindler's List and Batman: The Dark Knight Rises.

Fans found this highly amusing, with one tweeting "Liam Neeson #TheResponder" alongside 'crying with laughter' and 'facepalm' emojis.

Another added more hysterical emojis and wrote: "Oh Father Liam Neeson wtf are you doing #TheResponder."

A third simply said: "Liam, mate, we've all been there... #TheResponder."

Responder viewers were also delighted when they twigged who was playing the part of Father Liam Neeson.

Actor Matthew Cottle, from 90s sitcom Game On, took on the role of the drunk vicar and fans welcomed him back onto their screens.

Matthew played Martin Henson in the BBC2 series, which followed three pals living in flat-share in London.

Martin had no social life outside of the home, lived on his mum's frozen dinners and was unlucky in love.

"Martin from Game On is on #TheResponder!" one Responder viewer tweeted.

Another added: "Martin from Game On as the p***ed vicar #TheResponder!"

A third wrote: "The genius that is @MatthewCottle7 ladies and gentlemen. #TheResponder."

Matthew himself has now taken to Twitter, championing a return on Father Liam Neeson.

He tweeted: "Very fortunate to be playing a small role in the superb @theresponder tonight. Brilliantly written by @tonyshoey

"The campaign to bring Father Liam Neeson back for the next series begins now."
â€¢ The Responder concludes at 9pm, BBC1, on Wednesday February 2, 2022
