Kate and her mother read through the comments together, some of which shared experiences of losing a loved one to COVID-19. "I'd sit next to my mom and read her some of these comments, and we’d offer our condolences — they’re all genuine. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been negatively impacted," Kate expressed.



Diane also described the moment she made the decision to go to the emergency room and likened having COVID-19 to "a bad ride in an amusement park — a nasty scary ride." She elaborated, "I sort of felt like I couldn’t catch my breath. At one point, I was afraid that I wasn't going to keep breathing through the night. The next day, I realized that I wasn’t getting better, it was time."
