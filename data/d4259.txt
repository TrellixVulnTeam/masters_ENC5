Michael Fanone, the former D.C. Metropolitan Police officer who was badly beaten by a violent mob during the Capitol riot last year, on Monday likened Donald Trump to “America’s crazy ex.”

“He’s just decided that if he can’t have us, no one can, and he’s going to tear apart our democracy and our country if he can’t get reelected,” Fanone, who resigned from the police in December and is now a contributor for CNN, told anchor Anderson Cooper.

“There’s just no bottom to what it is he’s willing to say,” Fanone said during a discussion about Trump’s rally in Texas on Saturday. At the event, Trump called for protests in places where he is being investigated and dangled the prospect of pardons for those convicted for their roles in the insurrection at the Capitol.

“He still has a great deal of support in this country, and many of those supporters have already proven, like they did on Jan. 6, that they are willing to commit violence on his behalf,” Fanone said of Trump.
