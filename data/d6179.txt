In the very near future, the government will be reintroducing amendments to the Broadcasting Act previously known as Bill C-10.

Yes, C-10 had a handful of flaws, but at its core was a critical principle: to make sure internet giants that derive immense profits from Canada be forced to reinvest in Canadian producers. To quote the throne speech, “… ensure web giants pay their fair share for the creation and promotion of Canadian content.”

This is critical for broadcasters in this country, which have seen advertising dollars swiftly siphoned away by Google and Facebook. Just to give you a sense, last year, internet advertising grew by about $900 million to a grand total of almost $10 billion. To put that in perspective, companies spend about $15 billion on advertising in Canada every year. As of now, two-thirds is spent on the internet, and Google and Facebook account for more than 80 per cent of that figure.

There are more than 180 community broadcasters in Canada that have been particularly hit hard. These are the not-for-profit community-operated stations that live and broadcast in your neighbourhood. The broadcasting outlets are the few that still send reporters to city hall, the DJs you went to high school with and the ones who truly understand your community. 



On top of the loss of advertising dollars, the broadcasters rely on small- and medium-sized local businesses for advertising — the very same businesses that were hardest hit in the pandemic. Commercial broadcasters have seen national advertising return in a significant way.
