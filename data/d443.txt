If Jeremy Clarkson did vaccines rather than cars this would be his moment. A classic head to head - Pfizer versus Oxford - efficacy in place of torque, refrigeration temperatures substituted for miles per gallon.

It is tempting to do the same as a health journalist but it is not a good idea. As was noted at Wednesday’s briefing from the Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the two vaccines have not yet been tested head to head, so it’s impossible to say which is best.

But it is true, of course, that the Pfizer vaccine boasts an efficacy of 95 per cent, compared to something around the 70 per cent mark from Oxford. Immunity also appears to kick in a bit quicker with the Pfizer jab at 14 days, compared to 22 for Oxford’s shot.

In theory, at least, Pfizer’s RNA technology (although never used before in a mass vaccination programme) is also “cleaner” in the sense that the RNA code snippet it uses to deliver immunity vanishes from the body soon after doing its job.

But such comparisons are largely academic. The trial data for both vaccines is robust but limited and the real numbers on efficacy will only emerge a few years down the line once tens of millions of doses have been administered.

Much more important is that both vaccines, based on the trial data available, appear highly effective at protecting against severe disease. In all the trials run to date, no one vaccinated has been hospitalised or died of Covid-19. Experts are not yet certain if either prevent against transmission.
