In the 2020 election, I was still duped by the covid situation, and I voted for Biden with one of my reasons being “better handling of the pandemic”. Now that I’ve snapped out of it (in like January-February of 2021), I see that Biden is terrible and crushing the country and whatnot, and also that covid is a total fraud. So I deeply regret voting for him.

What I regret most about voting for him is the vaccine mandates. He’s just inflicting massive pain and suffering on people who have done absolutely nothing wrong. It’s sadistic and cruel. There’s no coherent rationale behind it at all. I’m honestly disgusted by this. Never have I thought so poorly of such a large amount of people.

When you talk to supporters of the mandates, you can almost hear the cruelty in their voice. They want the mandate so as to inflict pain and suffering on their perceived political opponents, and nothing else matters to them. Their position is truly absurd: “we’re mad at the unvaccinated for taking up too many hospital beds, so we want to fine them, segregate them from society, put them in camps, and take away their children.”

Biden’s mandates have caused immense damage and suffering, and I regret that I played a role in that. I sort of feel like I have blood of my hands TBH.
