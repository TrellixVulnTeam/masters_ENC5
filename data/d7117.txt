LISA Armstrong has been indulging fans with a plethora of sun-soaked snaps from her idyllic breakaway on Instagram.

The make-up artist treated her social media followers to a slew of shots from the beach and even shared several photos with her rarely-seen boyfriend James Green.

Although Lisa didn't reveal where they jetted off too, the pair looked happier than ever as they enjoyed some Winter sun at their "happy place".

Lisa even shared a snap of James enjoying a dip in the crystal clear water and joked "#Hot #Theviewisntbadeither".

The 45-year-old posted several beaming selfies of her herself, including two of her from her resort's spa.

In another shot, Lisa sported a pair of kooky pink-framed shades and a semi-sheer black cover-up as she relaxed on the beach.

Captioning the photo, she penned: "Sunny lazy days are the best!! Phew might need a dip… #Hot#Sun#HappyPlace 💕💕💕🌞🌞🌞".

In a new post shared yesterday, Lisa revealed she and James got matching "amore" hand tattoos after two years of dating.

After sharing the photos, Lisa was inundated with messages from friends and social media followers, who praised her relationship.

One claimed: "Definitely thrown away a stone an found your diamond, ❤️ x".

"You deserve all the happiness 🙏🏼💖❤️❤️❤️❤️xxxxx" another wrote.

A third shared: "This has made me smile youve been through so much smd now found the light you deserve it so much xxx".

"So pleased you are truly happy again😍," a fan added.

Lisa found love with electrician James, and the pair went public in August 2020.

Last month, it was reported that Lisa was set to "splash out on a swimming pool and gym".

Lisa is said to have drawn up plans for a pool, gym, gazbo and outhouse in the grounds of her new £3.8million home.

According to The Mirror, Lisa has submitted a planning application to her local council and is "excitedly" looking to the future following her £31million divorce from Ant McPartlin.

A source told the publication: "It has been a really upsetting and obviously distressing few years – but Lisa has bounced back and is firmly looking forward."

Lisa moved into her new home last year. The stunning house is semi-detached and has an impressive five bedrooms, four bathrooms, and two cloakrooms set across three floors.

The kitchen doors open into Lisa's 226ft garden, which she hopes to transform if her plans are approved by the council, that backs onto the River Thames.
