The Prime Minister has been accused of attending a leaving party for one of his senior advisors when the country was in lockdown last January, reports say.

Mr Johnson allegedly went to the gathering, which was held in Downing Street on January 14, while the rest of the nation was told to stay at home due to Coronavirus.

The Guardian reported that some Downing Street staff who attended had "downed prosecco" and the PM is understood to have given a speech thanking the member of staff for their hard work.

The gathering was one of several which had been revealed in Sue Gray's highly-anticipated report into Downing Street parties.

Her investigation into various lockdown parties this week revealed several events that had not previously been publicised.

The gathering on January 14 was held “on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries”.

Sources told The Guardian that the event was held as a "leaving do for a senior policy adviser who is now a top civil servant working in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport."

England’s third national Covid lockdown had been enforced just days earlier, on January 6 with the nation ordered to 'stay at home'.

The revelation made by The Guardian on Tuesday places Johnson at another event under investigation by the Metropolitan Police.

He also attended a “bring your own booze” party on 20 May 2020 and a 56th birthday celebration on 19 June that year.

A Foreign Office spokesperson told The Guardian: “It would not be appropriate to comment while a Metropolitan police investigation is ongoing.”
