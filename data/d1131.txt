"I've seen every single one of the [Batman] movies in the cinema, which I can't really say I've done for any other series", he said. "I was always really looking forward to them coming out. There was the combination of just being so attracted to it, but also feeling like it'd had a lot of movies made about it, and none of them are bad movies".
