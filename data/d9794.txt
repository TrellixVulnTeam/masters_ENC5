The Biden administration this week moved to tighten limits on the amount of mercury that can be discharged from coal-burning power plants.

Mercury is a neurotoxin that poses a particular danger to the brain development of children and fetuses. The Environmental Protection Agency has limited mercury emissions from coal plants since 2012. But, during the Trump administration, the agency concluded that the rule’s cost to industry outweighed its benefits and therefore it was no longer “appropriate and necessary.” That finding allowed the Trump administration to stop enforcing the mercury limit, even though it remained on the books.

On Monday, though, the administration said it would reinstate the Obama-era method of measuring the benefits of reducing air pollution. That would enable the E.P.A. to conclude that the costs of the rule to industry are offset by public health benefits such as prevention of disease and premature death. That, in turn, would provide the legal justification to enforce the existing mercury regulations.

As I wrote in an article on the mercury rule this week, the mercury announcement is among several recent actions taken or planned by the Biden administration aimed at strengthening and restoring environmental protections that had been rolled back by the Trump administration.

Quotable: “Sound science makes it clear that we need to limit mercury and toxins in the air to protect children and vulnerable communities from dangerous pollution,” Michael Regan, the E.P.A. administrator, said.
