We kick off the day with a jaw-dropping report from Rio Tinto into its workplace culture, which has revealed sexual assaults, harassment, racism and "systemic" bullying.

The Anglo-Australian miner revealed that 21 women have experienced actual or attempted rape or sexual assault at its mines over the last five years.

More than a quarter of women experienced sexual harassment at work, while almost half of all employees suffered bullying. Meanwhile, racism was found to be widespread across its operations in Australia and South Africa.

The eight-month study, conducted by former Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, surveyed more than 10,000 employees.
