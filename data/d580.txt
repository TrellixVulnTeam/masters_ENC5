A January move for the 25-year-old had been on the cards for some time but Spurs had planned to allow him to leave only on loan, as was the case with Tanguy Ndombele to Lyon and Bryan Gil’s move to Valencia. Giovani Lo Celso also joined Villarreal until the end of the season.

Just after midnight had passed after deadline day, the Toffees announced the deal on an initial free transfer.

A sum of £10million will be due after Dele plays 20 games for his new club, with the total cost of the move reaching as high as £30m with the midfielder signing a two-and-a-half-year-deal.

Everton confirmed the appointment of Frank Lampard as manager earlier on Monday and have also snapped up Donny van de Beek on loan from Manchester United. Crystal Palace had been chasing the Dutch midfielder.

Dele joined Spurs from MK Dons in 2015 and was seen as a long-term project for the Premier League club, however he quickly adapted to the top-flight and became a first-team regular under Mauricio Pochettino.
