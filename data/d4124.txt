Disneyland to Require Employees to Receive the COVID-19 Vaccine

Disneyland will require its employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as negotiations with the theme park unions close, according to the theme park’s union.

Workers United Local 50—a union that represents food and beverage employees announced the vaccine mandate for theme park staff on Jan. 27.

“After months of good faith negotiations on the matter … the company will be moving forward on a vaccine mandate for Local 50 and other Union’s not currently under a mandate,” the union wrote on Facebook.

Employees responded to the Facebook post opposing the mandate that will take effect on April 11.

“People with higher seniority than me should refuse the vaccine,” one employee wrote.

Meanwhile, others applauded the mandate and urged the theme park to require guests to show proof of the jab to enter.

“All unions should demand for a mandatory vaccine mandate for the guests,” another employee wrote.

Religious and medical exemptions will be made available for Disneyland employees to submit by the deadline.

The Epoch Times reached out to United Local 50 Union but did not receive a comment by deadline.
