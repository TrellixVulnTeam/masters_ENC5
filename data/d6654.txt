A SOUTHAMPTON man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and drug cultivation after police discovered a large cannabis factory.

Officers were called to an Eastleigh High Street address at 2am this morning (February 2) and found two men with injuries.

A "large group" of people had been reported to the force, but they had fled the scene before emergency services arrived.

Officers located and detained a man who had been seen by local CCTV operators leaving the scene shortly after the incident towards Leigh Road.

A 27-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and cultivating a Class B drug.
