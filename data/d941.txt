ith no parties, nowhere to go, and no-one to mix with, tonight is hardly going to be the party of the year. On the other hand, it does mean it won’t be another evening of running over all the year’s highs and lows which, let’s be frank, would be a grim chat.

But so what if we’re all stuck indoors? It needn’t mean there’s no fun to be hard. Instead, dig out the cocktail shaker, spend a little of that Christmas money on stocking up your back bar and get mixing.

New Year’s Eve may traditionally call for Champagne – and quite right, too – but to avoid waking up on New Year’s Day with a stonking headache and acid reflux from hell, try a cocktail before you get into the bubbles. Here’s to 2021 which, surely, can only be an improvement.

At New Year’s, sometimes keeping things simple is the way to go: done right, it’s a long night, so no need to spend too much of it getting fussy with cocktail shakers. This is one of those easy-as-anything winners; Kol’s bar manager Maxim Schulte, pictured above with Kol founder Santiago Lastra, has pitched this one for a party.

This one combines two classic winter flavours: chestnuts, and the comfort of a good Manhattan. The result is a classic cocktail, but one boosted with a bit more of the those brown, leathery, woody flavours – the chestnut really makes a difference. It’s an elegant drink with a welcome kick to it. If, despite Tier 4 lockdown, you’re still getting dressed up and going for it, this is the thing to drink.

New Year’s Eve is likely to be a sit down affair this year; this one makes a fun, fizz-fueled pudding. That said, this Italian speciality is actually one of those fresh, easy-going drinks that can be knocked back in all of a gulp, with the oh-so-dangerous feeling there might not be any booze it in after all. Take it easy; you’ll feel it hit soon enough.
