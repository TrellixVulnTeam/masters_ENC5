DESTINY DAYS: There’s something special about you on Tuesday, and it lasts till the weekend. Go work that charm! Reset commitment “2“ dates.

Intense bath oils and body lotions, huge fluffy towels and bath robes and a private at-home deep tissue massage can be top of the list. But Scorpio also melts over private, personal presents like a handwritten poem, or a framed pic of a special together time.

STAR SPARKLER: Topaz enhances Scorpio/November focus and calm, inside and out.
