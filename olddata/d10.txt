WASHINGTON — A $3 trillion burst of economic assistance from the federal government has fueled a faster-than-expected rebound in hiring amid the coronavirus pandemic. That bounce suggests the economy is slowly healing, but it could also encourage Republican lawmakers to shut off some aid to people and companies prematurely, undermining that very recovery.

The surprise news that the economy added 2.5 million jobs in May, with unemployment dropping to 13.3 percent, emboldened congressional Republicans who have been reluctant to extend expensive jobless benefits and small-business loans. Many economists, in stark contrast, said the rebound was predicated on federal aid and pleaded with Congress not to relent on spending that has helped keep workers employed and bolstered consumer spending amid a swift and steep recession.

Republicans have acknowledged that some sort of legislation addressing the impact of the pandemic is likely. But the numbers released Friday, aides said, vindicated their reluctance to pursue another large, sweeping package. Instead, lawmakers are looking to a more limited measure that would include new spending and focus on reopening state economies.

“As Senate Republicans have made clear for weeks, future efforts must be laser-focused on helping schools reopen safely in the fall, helping American workers continue to get back on the job, and helping employers reopen and grow,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said in a statement.
